# Retrieval, Capture

*Retrieval, snapshot, mirroring, loading*

Based on the datum content type and user signals, retrieve and possibly act on the retrieved object. Examples:

- Download the tiktok or youtube video referenced, in the highest quality, and store it. Then transcribe the video and summarize the transcription. Place all references (original URL, snapshot URL, transcription, summary, and any highlights or notes provided at time of capture into an object and add that object to some Collections;

- Take a snapshot of a web page (PDF or other), using the user's login credentials if needed, along with highlights and notes collected by the user. Summarize the content and store in a collection;

- Add a torrent to the anonymous/VPN download queue

- etc

## Information Collection and Mining

*Information Collections/Reference*

Ensure this capture is easily surfaced later, by recording it along with its matched effort in threads/collections, and add it to a knowledge graph if one exists.

Captures should retain metadata about time, location, source, app, etc etc in a time-series form to help the user infer past context, using this data as well as other related data from other systems.

Ex: “which Document should i update for this capture?”
