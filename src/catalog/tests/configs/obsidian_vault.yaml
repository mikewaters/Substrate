# Sample ingestion job config — exercises all supported options.
#
# Usage:
#   from catalog.ingest.pipelines import IngestPipeline
#   pipeline = IngestPipeline()
#   result = pipeline.ingest_from_config(Path("configs/sample_vault.yaml"))
#
# Hydra variable interpolation is supported:
#   ${source.type}  resolves to "obsidian"
#   ${embedding.model_name} resolves to the model name string

source:
  type: heptabase                          # Literal["heptabase"]
  source_path: /Users/mike/Develop/lifeos/substrate/src/catalog/tests/corpus/vault-small

# embedding: (optional — omit to use application-level IDX_EMBEDDING_* settings)
