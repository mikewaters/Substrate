# THIS.md (Heptabase)

+ ## Whiteboards

   Heptabase boards represent my [Knowledge Management Structure .md](./Knowledge%20Management%20Structure%20.md): Work, Brain, Library, Thinking, and Study. Improving my Knowledge Management practice is given a lot of attention, as part of Work.

   1. [ 👨🏻‍💻 LifeOS.md](../Whiteboard/%20👨🏻‍💻%20LifeOS.md) [THIS.md (lifeos board).md](./THIS.md%20\(lifeos%20board\).md)

      1. Work as well as working out my PKM project

   2. [🧠 Brain.md](../Whiteboard/🧠%20Brain.md) [this.md (Brain).md](./this.md%20\(Brain\).md) - “Second Brain”

   3. [ 📚 Library.md](../Whiteboard/%20📚%20Library.md) [this.md (Library).md](./this.md%20\(Library\).md)

      1. Reference/collection and landscape docs

   4. [ 🤔 Thinking.md](../Whiteboard/%20🤔%20Thinking.md)

   5. [Study 2.md](../Whiteboard/Study%202.md)

   6. [Map of Content.md](../Whiteboard/Map%20of%20Content.md)

      1. An information model that connects data from across the entire PKM. 

      2. While the Heptabase “map” serves to provide navigability for the user (me) - facilitating the act of locating a single piece of content (for retrieval or update) - this map instead serves to connect possibly disparate information in a way that facilitates understanding or [Grounding.md](./Grounding.md).

   7. [Logbooks.md](../Whiteboard/Logbooks.md) 

      1. A collection of notes that I am working on, that should be easily accessible.
