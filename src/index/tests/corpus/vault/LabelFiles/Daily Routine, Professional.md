## Email

1. Skim inbox for anything important, and flag it.

2. Review flagged items and handle them

# Daily Review

**When**: Before I close my laptop for the day

1. Make a note of the projects I spent time on, to make my timesheet easier

2. Go through my paper notes for the day, and:

   - Mark any action items for processing the next day (in a perfect world, these would go into a Task List)

   - Add any interesting items as candidates for my EOW status report

   - Add items to my reading list if applicable
