# Recommended: keep logic in tools/ so hooks stay readable.

[post-create]
# 1) Optional: speed up new worktrees by copying caches/deps that are gitignored.
#    Example: node_modules, .venv, target, build, etc (depending on your .gitignore).
#    Safe to remove if you prefer clean bootstraps.
#copy_ignored = "wt step copy-ignored --from main --to {{ branch }}"

# 2) Repo-specific bootstrap: deps, env files, ports, etc.
bootstrap = "./tools/worktrunk/bootstrap.sh"

# 3) Optional: open an “agent cockpit” in tmux with panes for Claude/Codex/tests.
#    If you don't use tmux, delete this line.
tmux = "./tools/worktunk/tmux.sh"
