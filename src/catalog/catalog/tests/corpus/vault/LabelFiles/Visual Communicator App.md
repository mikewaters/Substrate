# Visual Communicator App

Turn your feelings/ideas/thoughts into visualizations - models - to help other people understand them, if you are bad with words.

Like a guided powerpoint/whiteboard infinite canvas presentation; an LLM system prompt sets up $somethingTBD that can guide a person to ways they can visualize certain types of thoughts or ideas.
