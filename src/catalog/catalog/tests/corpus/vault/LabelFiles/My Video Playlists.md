## Target state

### Mood-based

Playlists should be “mood based”, rather than subject matter or presentation style etc. though those might be used for an edge case.

“I feel like watching or feeling …”, “I need this kind of motivation boost “, “I need background sound for sleeping or for cooking”

### Subject matter, Presentation style

Content type and style are going to be imporrant though, and the only way to make it work is to use automatic classification. Then I can drill down to some “mood” or context playlist, OR zoom out to some vertical like subject matter or short-form or whatever.

### Multiple independent viewer apps

YT’s app does not fit the model of what I would like to do. The `Play` app goes a long way though, and so I should use them both.

1. Subscribe to a channel in YT, but not in `Play`

   1. Creators that I actively seek out; “my favorite shows”

2. Unsubscribe from a channel in YT, subscribe in 3rd-party app

   1. Creators who product a lot of interesting content (“my favorite $X”), but I am infrequently in the mood to watch it.

   2. The content needs to be presented in a meaningful way in Play, so that I can find it easily.

3. Subscribe to a channel in both apps

   1. Creators produce a lot, and I want to watch some of it frequently while also the content fits one of the niches handled in `Play`.

I should also add some channels to my video app, as for many of them I can watch every video (like stereo repair), no need to save them to a playlist. 

Same as Dave’s auto

Something like “The Regz” needs a solution though, as there is more than one channel and they post more than just regz content. Can the player app make this work?

Can I plug into the player app??? Inference

I also need a way to export project materials from YouTube; playlists seem like an obvious way to do that. However there’s no way to say what the video is relevant to. Maybe I should share to heptabase.

For conferences, I should ignore YouTube’s Ui altogether and just subscribe to those channels in the Play app.
