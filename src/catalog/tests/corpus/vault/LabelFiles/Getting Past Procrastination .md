# Getting Past Procrastination 

## Some synthesis of Huberman

**Procrastination is a Threat Response**

### “Future you” is a stranger; talk to them

Your brain sees "future you" as a stranger.  That's why it's so easy to push work to "tomorrow you."

But researchers found a solution that dropped procrastination by 60%: show yourself that "future you" is real. 

They had people write detailed letters from their "future self":

- How they felt after procrastinating

- The stress it caused

- The relief when they didn't

### Work when your body wants it

But the biggest discovery came from brain scans: Your prefrontal cortex (logical brain) loses to your limbic system (emotional brain) when you're Tired, Stressed, and Overwhelmed, and so **timing actually matters more than willpower.**

The science showed that morning people procrastinate less until 2pm, while night owls perform better after 4pm.

It's not about forcing yourself to work. It's about working when your brain is ready for battle.

### Action + Focus beats “thinking about it”

Researchers found chronic procrastinators share one habit: They try to fix the behavior by thinking about it.

But studies show: Action + Focus beats thinking. Even 2 minutes work rewires your brain's threat response.
