Hi. I think you need to let go of the idea of managing this medium stage IBD disease with diet and probiotics. What you are doing is creating more inflammation in the GI tract with the diet changes. Inflammation is bad. Untreated, it can lead to cancer like small or large cell lymphoma. Diet alone and probiotics won’t stop inflammation. The best you can hope to do is not cause additional inflammation with a diet.

When treating IBD it is best to use a novel protein source that your cat has never been exposed to before. Let’s say venison. Canned is always better than dry for cats due to the higher amount of moisture in canned and the low to no carbohydrates in canned. It is important to read cat food labels really well if you aren’t going to use a veterinary brand like Royal
Canin ‘s Pd, or PV formula. I have found many of the canned rabbit, or venison or duck diets sold in pet stores also have beef or chicken in them somewhere.

Once starting a novel protien diet, it is highly recommended that you feed only that for the next 2 to 3 months. If even one treat is given it will nullify the trial.

Any change in diet won’t be immediate. It can take months. That is why medication is usually needed. I would not do a raw diet for a cat with IBD. Their immune system is already compromised.

Medication wise, if she is vomiting, she needs anti-nausea medication to prevent it. Every time she vomits it is more damaging to her.

Often cats with IBD need appetite stimulants to get them eating. This is only short term.

My own cat had IBD and I chose to treat with diet change only. Now she has lymphoma and not only does she get steroids, but also chemotherapy.

I don't think it's unrealistic to try to manage with diet and supplements, but it's very difficult. RAWZ rabbit is one of the best canned foods out there and is one often recommended. Try to stay away from chicken and chicken blend. We actually ended up finding success with RAWZ duck and turkey flavors as well as ZiwiPeak Lamb. We also fed Royal Canin Gastrointestinal dry food in snack size portions.

I would highly suggest keeping anti-nausea and antacid meds on hand to treat when not wanting to eat. Your kitty may not be adverse to the food, but may be experiencing nausea or even gas. We give (I have a pancreatitis/IBD kitty now, too) Zofran or its generic Ondansetron and sometimes Cerenia for nausea. They work differently and treat different things. We have more luck with Ondansetron on a daily basis, but when really nauseous we add in Cerenia. For gas, we give Simethicone (baby gas drops) and that helps soothe the tummy as well. B12 injections can really be a lifesaver, too. Those really helped my IBD boy. We did the normal process, which is once a week for a month to 6 weeks, then monthly, but found every 3 weeks worked best for him. Of course, prednisolone can also be a game-changer as that keeps inflammation down and can encourage eating. We also have transdermal Mirataz on hand when kitty goes on a hunger strike.

As far as supplements, Adored Beast Gut Soothe and Healthy Gut may be helpful. Neither helped my IBD boy, but Healthy Gut is working for my panc/IBD girlie. We also have GastroElm Plus to try, but I've not added it to her medications yet because she's doing well right now.

B12 supplementation

Probiotics

A third component that is strongly recommended is the probiotics, and you've already ordered two of the best probiotics available. We personally use Visbiome and Adored Beast's Felix's Flora (the FF is the only one with feline-specific strains). Visbiome also offers Constipation Care if other supplements don't work (such as Miralax or psyllium fiber). Another option for constipation is Vet's Best Hairball Relief tablets because they have psyllium fiber plus gut soothing ingredients such as marshmallow root and slippery elm. It's intended to help hairballs move through their GI tract but it helps anything move through, including poop.
