# Cognitive Impedance Mismatch Friction

Where I do not have a good mapping between my mental model of a domain and the working model of some task or process needed within that domain, it becomes difficult to achieve anything in that domain. I will continually thrash on whatever options I am afforded, structuring and restructuring over and over.

### Friction

In our interactions with the world, we act within many contexts and dimensions, and this can be modeled using a domain-driven approach. I have chosen to model my interactions in the way that makes sense to me, that fits my mental world-model that’s been building over all the years of my adulthood (or Self-Awareness).

I am however unable to work effectively within these domains, and it is a constant trouble to me. From making appointments (and making it to the appointments), or remembering to brush my teeth, to ensuring that I am at least set up for happiness and success and living according to my values, I regularly miss despite the confidence that am *able* to hit. It is this ability that I hope to achieve, and that I pursue.

Part of the reason is related to memory issues (more specifically to The Cue), part of it is I haven’t learned how, and the rest is that I lack the execution and follow-through due to all of an inherent distractibility, a lack of basic resting comfort (which additonially drives me to distracting activities), and chemical imbalances that leave me prone to down-ness and lacking up-ness.

I am now and have in the past brought to bear assistive tooling to like a crutch help to balance out my weaknesses and fill in capabilities that I lack. This tooling is actual tools, like software tools, but also behaviors, processes, and methodologies that I can delegate responsiblity to within some domain of the world interaction. The tooling also includes documentation of my mental world-model and tool use, serving as itself a reminder for my damaged brain.

Unfortunately, there is no One Tool to manage this all. There isnt even One Tool to manage some subset that also fits my mental model and allows me to operate frictionless. And so in addition to needing to “glue” all the tools together, I need to improve them somehow, to make them easier to us.

Examples:

1. I love Tana, but I just cannot organize it in a way that it easy for me to both get data *in* and meaning *out*.

2. Heptabase is great, but it just needs a little *noodge* to (for example) display metadata near the card title so that I don’t get lost in the sea of cards.



### Thrashing

This happens at the macro level, on down to the micro; at the top, Productivity in general is really difficult for me because I do not have a good model of how I need to operate in order to be productive. And so I have created many many iterations of “systems” (on *major* version 4 now) over and over. 

On the micro level, some smaller domain like ‘Work’  may need a tool like ClickUp, but I keep thrashing again and again on the structure within that tool, which is all I can really control - I cannot after all modify their codebase to add the features I need and remove the things that annoy me.

Drafts as well; I’ve changed my tag structure numerous times, and it still isn’t correct. Heck I’ve used twenty note-taking tools over the years, and I still havent settled on anything. There’s still information in 6 or 7 f them, compounding the problem.

It is for these reasons that I am writing my own code; I will find the “spaces in-between”, where I need to have some custom helper behavior, and I will create that behavior using software, and bridge that software with other tools, providing those tools with super powers.
