AKA Captains Log

One of:: [📒 LifeOS Use Case Log.md](./📒%20LifeOS%20Use%20Case%20Log.md)\\

Caps: Capture, Cross-reference

Time-series capture of life events, and correlating them to something

Examples

- chewy sjit in the actual bed today

- squeak had X cans of food



Things I should write down, but usually forget to. If I do remember, well that note could be in any of ten note taking tools.

[Time Efficiency.md](./Time%20Efficiency.md), [Emotional Efficiency.md](./Emotional%20Efficiency.md): Having log-data in once place saves time searching for it, and resultant anxiety and avoidance

Time Efficiency in that I wont have to (really, or digitally) “get out a pad and pen” to make an important note.

Log-data is relevant to the [Manage Life-data in one place.md](./Manage%20Life-data%20in%20one%20place.md) use case.
