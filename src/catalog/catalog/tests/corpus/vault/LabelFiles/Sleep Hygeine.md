# Sleep Hygeine

If you had to choose between changing your wake up time to be earlier, or changing your bedtime to be earlier , which one would be better for the goal of waking up early every day and going to bed early?

If considering this hypothetically, I think changing the bedtime to be earlier would be more effective for establishing a consistent early sleep-wake schedule. Here's my reasoning:

Starting with an earlier bedtime helps create the physiological conditions needed for earlier waking. When you consistently go to bed earlier, your body's circadian rhythm gradually adjusts, naturally making it easier to wake up early. Simply forcing an earlier wake time without changing bedtime would likely lead to sleep deprivation.

Additionally, trying to wake up earlier while keeping a late bedtime means fighting against your body's accumulated sleep pressure and circadian rhythm, which often results in hitting snooze or oversleeping. An earlier bedtime, on the other hand, ensures you get adequate sleep duration and are naturally ready to wake when morning comes.

What time are you currently going to bed and waking up? Understanding your current schedule could help think through how to adjust it most effectively.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
