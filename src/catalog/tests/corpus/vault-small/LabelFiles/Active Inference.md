# Active Inference

 introduced in the early 2000s in a series of papers by neuroscientist and theoretical neurobiologist, Karl Friston - active inference is a theory of how the brain uses statistical inference and generative world models to predict sensory inputs and guide actions to minimize prediction errors - helping explain human perception, action and learning

\> Perception updates our generative world model to reduce errors in prediction while actions change our environment to align with our predictions - minimizing the probability of errors in our predictions
