# Enforcing ownership of our digital collections

Sony PlayStation recently revoked all digital purchases, by redefining ownership terminology in their ToS. Other video vendors, maybe all of them, have done this as well as redefined the term “lifetime” to have a ridiculous limit of some small number of years. We need to take ownership of Books, Videos, Music.

Roku recently forced a new ToS that, among other things, includes a forced arbitration clause.
