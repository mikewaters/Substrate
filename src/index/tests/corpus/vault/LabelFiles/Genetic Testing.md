BRCA2 for prostate and breast cancer



raindrop/Gene Testing

I want to have my genes analyzed to see if i have any specific defects or superpowers that having knowledge of will help me in my life improvement goals.

> If you ask anyone who works in genetics, though, they'll advise you never to do it. It can be bad news, but there's virtually no good news there.

Example:

> Genetic Lifehacks **makes it easy** to use your genetic data to find personalized health and wellness solutions.

Getting genetic testing privately:

> To determine whether you're a slow or fast caffeine metabolizer..
>
>  Wait for a sale at [Nebula.org](Nebula.org). Get your whole genome sequenced. \~$200. Having your whole genome sequenced could have added benefits down the road.
>
> Download the .BAM file. It will be several gigabytes.
>
> Use WSG Extract to generate the 23andMe raw data files.
>
> <https://www.geneticlifehacks.com/convert-whole-genome-file/>
>
> Connect that data file to Genetic Life Hacks. Take a look at the article on CYP1A2. This will show you whether you're a slow metabolizer or not.

>
> The data file never uploads to the server. All analysis is local, client side.

> Probably though 23andMe and the CYP450 enzyme CYP1A2.
