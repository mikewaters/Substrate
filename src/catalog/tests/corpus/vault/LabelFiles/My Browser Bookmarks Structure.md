# My Browser Bookmarks Structure

Related: Consolidate my Bookmarks (Objective)

### Objectives

Create a defined structure for URL storage, that is used across web browsers, Raindrop, and other tools. Utilize defined LifeOS Ontology where possible.

### Principles

Not every object that has an associated URL needs to be stored in this way; they can be retrieved and stored elsewhere, with the URL as a reference; only if I need to access that URL in the future should I actually be capturing it in a bookmark.

### Todo

- [x] Refactor the raindrop folder structure

- [ ] Reorganize raindrop bookmarks in the new hierarchy

- [ ] Refactor my web browser bookmarks across browsers

   - [ ] Find a tool to sync bookmarks across browsers

- [ ] Copy recipes out of raindrop

## Browser bookmarks

Meant more for locality-of-reference, where the things I need to *use* are close at hand and easy to find. When I need to use a web browser for some activity, I need that activity’s required resources to be findable.

- Use/purpose: Regular activities, like writing code, doing work, researching, paying a bill, etc

- Attributes: Low frequency of storage, higher frequency of use

- Organizing principles: Easy to find without using metadata, and easy to store; requires simplicity and predictability

- System attributes:

   - Structured hierarchical classification (aka folders) to make finding straightforward

### Should-have

- Services and admin tools

- Anything regularly used

### Should not have

### Structure

- Bookmarks Toolbar/Favorites

   - *quick-use folders and favicons for often-used bookmarks, which are probably also stored in Bookmarks*

- Bookmarks

   - services

      - ai

      - products

      - pairing

   - local

   - reading/forums

   - shopping

   - quail

   - personal

   - referenceinfo

      - dashboards

      - shirtcats

   - digital tools

## Bookmarks Manager

[Raindrop.io.md](./Raindrop.io.md)

More of content and reference storage, attached to a personal interest that might be needed for a project some day, or to some short or long term effort I am engaging in.

- Use/purpose: Warm and cold storage of useful content, which I could not trivially find myself if I needed to search the internet

- Attributes: High frequency of storing, low frequency of use

- Organizing principles: Easy to save while still attaching the required metadata to surface later for some effort, or allow an agent to proactively associate to that effort

- System attributes:

   - Long-term caching for URL resources

   - Unstructured classification (aka tags, folders etc), to make search easier.

   - Ability to make notes for classification or retrieval later

### Should-have

### Should not have

- Services and admin tools

- Anything that requires a login

- Anything that changes over time, like a feed

### Structure

- Inspo

- My/Thinking

- My/Vision Boards

- My/Responsibilities

   - *\[Areas of Responsibility\]*

- My/Projects

   - Items with a time component

   - *\[named Efforts\]*

- Interests/Artificial Intelligence *(Subject)*

- Interests/Programming *(Subject)*

- Interests

   - *\[Topics\]*

- Reference/Man Pages

   - *\[Things that need instructions\]*

- Research Subjects

- Research Topics

- Things

## Other systems

There are other types of resources that are tied to an URL, but I want to consume them elsewhere; examples of this are recipes to try.

For these items, I should capture the contents of the URL and store *that*, keeping the URL for a reference but its OK if that remote content disappears.
