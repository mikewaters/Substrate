# 23andme Bankruptcy

With 23andMe’s recent bankruptcy filing, it’s prudent to take steps to secure your genetic data. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you:



1\. Download Your Raw DNA Data:



To retain a personal copy of your genetic information:

• Access Your Account: Log in to your 23andMe account.

• Navigate to Settings: Click on your profile name or icon and select “Settings.”

• Locate Data Download Section: Scroll to the “23andMe Data” section and click “View.”

• Request Data Download: Follow the prompts to request your raw data. You’ll receive an email notification once it’s ready for download.



2\. Delete Your Genetic Data and Account:



To ensure your data isn’t accessible to potential buyers:

• In Account Settings: Within the “23andMe Data” section, select “Permanently Delete Data.”

• Confirm Deletion: You’ll receive an email to confirm your request. Once confirmed, the deletion process will begin, and access to your account will be lost.



3\. Request Destruction of Your Biological Sample:



If you provided a saliva sample:

• Contact Customer Care: Email 23andMe’s customer support to request the destruction of your stored biological sample.



Important Considerations:

• Data Retention Policies: While 23andMe states that personal information will be deleted upon request, some data may be retained as required by law.

• Legal Protections: The U.S. lacks comprehensive federal privacy laws governing genetic data, which means your information could be considered an asset in bankruptcy proceedings.

• State Recommendations: Attorneys general in states like California have advised residents to delete their data and request sample destruction to protect their privacy.



Next Steps:

• Stay Informed: Monitor communications from 23andMe regarding the status of your data and any changes due to the bankruptcy proceedings.

• Consult Legal Advice: If you have concerns about your data privacy rights, consider consulting with a legal professional familiar with data protection laws.



By proactively managing your genetic data, you can better safeguard your personal information during this transitional period for 23andMe.
