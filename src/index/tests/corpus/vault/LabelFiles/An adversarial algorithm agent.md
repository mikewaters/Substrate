# An adversarial algorithm agent

Related: [My Thoughts on AI.md](./My%20Thoughts%20on%20AI.md)

## Problem

Algorithms control, guide, constrain, or manipulate our thoughts more and more. These algorithms are inscrutable to us, and operate in ways that are difficult to control or to even understand.

How can we deploy an anti-algorithm that is tailored to our goals and beliefs? Can it block us from seeing things we do not like, and could it further train the algorithm adversaries in hopes that they don’t show that again?

Example: An agent that monitors your TikTok feed - running “in front” of you - and skips or dislikes crap.
