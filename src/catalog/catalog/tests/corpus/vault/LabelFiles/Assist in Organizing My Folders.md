# Assist in Organizing My Folders

Assistants —> Agents

One of:: [📒 LifeOS Use Case Log.md](./📒%20LifeOS%20Use%20Case%20Log.md)

Caps: Classify, Cross-reference, Agent

Depends on:: [Tell me where this document belongs, or where I can find that document.md](./Tell%20me%20where%20this%20document%20belongs,%20or%20where%20I%20can%20find%20that%20document.md)

A document classifier that 1: reports what is actually in a folder (recursively) and 2: offers suggestions about how to reorganize 

If the Overlord knows what’s in a given folder, the reporting will be easier, and it can store that fact for later if it doesn’t have it. If it knows where something is supposed to be (and it isn’t), it can make good recommendations; if it doesn’t know about that file already, then it can store that as well.

The Overlord can work locally - just making suggestions about what’s found and how to better organize it - or it can go a step further and save all the context it gleans (like what a given doc was) so that later you can use that to make updates to The System to improve it. Or both, or it can even make the improvements autonomously.

“THIS IS ALL THE STUFF I FOUND, HERES HOW YOU SHOULD ORGANIZE IT. HEY GUESS WHAT I KNOW WHY SOME OF IT EXISTS AND I CAN SAVE THAT TOO”

IOW

1. while examining a folder, surface data of interest that exists and can be identified, and record the results 

   1. Record Potential System Updates: store a reference to that data in the system, if unknown; 

   2. Record what’s found: if known, record that fact, otherwise record the interesting data as well as that it was stored and where 

   3. use any context that’s provided in [THIS.md.md](./THIS.md.md) 

   4. Record your ideas: correlate any new data references to other entities, if possible; record how the interesting data might be correlated (or do it)

2. Analyze what’s found, use your ideas to make suggestions about how to change the way that folder is organized

3. Save the good ideas for later.
