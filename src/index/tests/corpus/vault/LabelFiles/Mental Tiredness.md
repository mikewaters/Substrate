# Mental Tiredness

- The brains structures requireand ingest nutrients for operation

   - oxygen and glucose

- These structures also create waste

- Waste needs to be cleaned up

- Similar cognitive tasks use the same structures in the brain

- We evolved to perform varied tasks that leverage varied brain and body structures

- Our brains can shuffle resources around to structures that currently demand it

- Our brains resource requirements are fairly constant, cognitively demanding tasks don’t (necessarily?) require more resources

- Our work and our relaxation resemble each other from a cognitive demand perspective (screens)

- When not using varied structures, overusing a structure, waste can accumulate because it cannot be eliminated fast enough (it is not used to it!)

- Accumulated waste can make you feel bad

   - brain fatigue, existential despair

- Accumulated waste can even damage neurons

- 5-15 minute breaks can help
