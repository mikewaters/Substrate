# Tap water issues at Quall Run

Tap water turning green when I add iodized salt for boiling pasta Mar 19, 2025

Have the tap water checked for iron and copper.

When iodized salt is added to tap water, the green discoloration is typically caused by chemical reactions involving metals present in the water, particularly iron. Here's a breakdown of the key factors:

---

### **Iron Reaction with Iodized Salt**

1. **Electrolysis Effects**:\
   If iodized saltwater undergoes electrolysis (e.g., using iron electrodes like paperclips), iron from the electrodes reacts with hydroxide ions, forming \*\*ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)₂)\*\*—a green precipitate\[2\]\[5\]. This is common in DIY experiments where tap water contains dissolved iron or the electrodes themselves corrode.

2. **Natural Iron in Water**:\
   Tap water may contain ferrous (dissolved) or ferric (oxidized) iron\[3\]. When iodized salt (containing iodide) is added, chlorine/chloramine residuals in treated water can react with iodide, forming **iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs)**. While these are linked to toxicity\[1\]\[4\], they don’t directly explain the green color. However, iron in the water can oxidize and combine with iodine, contributing to greenish hues\[5\].

### **Copper Contamination**

In rare cases, green/blue water indicates **copper corrosion** from pipes\[6\]. However, this is unrelated to iodized salt unless the salt accelerates pipe corrosion. Copper levels exceeding 1–2 mg/L pose health risks and require plumbing inspection\[6\].

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Primary Cause**: Green water from iodized salt + tap water is most likely due to **iron reactions** (e.g., electrolysis or iron-rich water).

- **Safety**: While iron-related discoloration is generally harmless, I-DBPs formed during cooking with chlorinated water and iodized salt may pose health risks\[1\]\[4\].

- **Testing**: If green water persists without electrolysis, test for iron or copper levels and inspect plumbing\[3\]\[6\].

For practical solutions, avoid electrolysis with iron electrodes or switch to non-iodized salt if metals are present in your water supply.
