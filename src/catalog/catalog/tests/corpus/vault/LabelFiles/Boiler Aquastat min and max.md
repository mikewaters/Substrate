### Rule of Thumb for Setting HI LO DIFF on an Aquastat

Or more commonly, we were taught to just use a "rule of thumb" which set the

- **HI** to 180 °F (should be 200F or lower)

   - a HI-DIFF value is hard-wired in the R8182 series type aquastats, is not adjustable, and no control dial is provided.\
      \
      A programmable HI-DIFF *is* available on on some programmable aquastats such as\
      \
      the [AQUASTAT L7224U UNIVERSAL](https://inspectapedia.com/heat/Aquastat_Honeywell_L7224U.php) and can be adjusted.

- **LO** to 160 °F (must be 20 below HI)

   - **DIFF** (or LO-DIFF) on most aquastats such works with the LO limit only and is often set to 10, or is just set randomly (not recommended - proper numbers are below) .
