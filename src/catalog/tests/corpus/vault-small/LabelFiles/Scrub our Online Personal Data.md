## Understanding how companies use our data

## Scrubbing Social Media and the Web

This includes Facebook/Twitter et al, but also BlueSky or Mastodon or forums or Pixelmator etc. Deep research into old email accounts etc.

### Approach: OSINT tools

Use Open Source Intelligence tools to scour the internet for old stuff, and have it removed.

> Note: Utilize one of those Data Broker tools, they may support wider web removal

## Data Brokers

### Approach: Hiring a vendor to automate the removal

Essentially, the tradeoffs here are automation and cost.

#### Manual intervention by you

Some data brokers require a human to be involved in the process. For some of these, you can just pay more to a company to do this on your behalf, but for others you actually need to engage and do something (aka spend time).

#### Automated removal

Vendors have automated a lot of this, some more than others. Some vendors handle mostly or completely automated removal only.

#### Plan for having our data removed from data brokers

> Note: Consider a vendor that supports scrubbing from other platforms like social media or websites (results that I may find using OSINT)

1. Step 1: Start with an automated provider. 

   1. It will cost less

   2. It will be far less comprehensive

   3. It requires no effort on our part

   4. Choosing a vendor (and “[Closing a Door.md](./Closing%20a%20Door.md)”) is less impactful, because I may just cancel later when I go to step 2

   5. This will get us familiar with the process and complexity, so we can get a better understanding of what we are missing by not doing the manual ones

2. Step 2: Later, upgrade to a higher cost provider that will be comprehensive, at the cost of money and time
