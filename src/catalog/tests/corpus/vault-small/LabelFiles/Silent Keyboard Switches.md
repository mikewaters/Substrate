# Silent Keyboard Switches

KeebFinder has a [search-by-switch](https://keeb-finder.com/keyboards?order=Newest+first&ms_switchType=Silent&page=10)

## “Silent” Switch Types

### Silent Tactile vs Silent Linear

> Silent tactile and silent linear switches both have dampeners/padding materials added to reduce noise, but their fundamental mechanisms and resulting sound profiles differ:
>
> Silent Linear Switches:
>
> - Completely smooth keystroke with no bump
>
> - Usually slightly quieter overall since there's no tactile mechanism
>
> - Both downstroke and upstroke are dampened
>
> - Common examples: **Cherry MX Silent Red**, **Gateron Silent Red**
>
> - Generally considered the quietest option
>
> Silent Tactile Switches:
>
> - Has a small bump during keystroke (usually around 2mm down)
>
> - The tactile mechanism creates a tiny bit more noise than linear
>
> - Both downstroke and upstroke are dampened, but the tactile bump itself can produce a very subtle sound
>
> - Common examples: **Cherry MX Silent Brown, Gateron Silent Brown**
>
> - Still very quiet, but usually slightly louder than silent linears
>
> For pure sound reduction, silent linear switches are typically the better choice since they have fewer moving parts and no tactile mechanism to generate noise.

- | I’d suggest going with Leopold or Varmilo keyboards with silent switches, as they lube the modifier and space bar keys so they all press relatively quietly
