# Detect and analyze radio signals that might be interfering with Wifi

To detect and analyze aberrant radio signals that might be interfering with your WiFi, you’ll need specialized equipment that can identify signals across a broader spectrum. Here are some suitable devices and tools:

### 1\. **RF Spectrum Analyzer**

- **What it does**: A spectrum analyzer scans the radio frequency (RF) spectrum to detect signals from all devices, including non-WiFi ones.

- **Recommended Models**:

   - **HackRF One** (affordable software-defined radio)

   - **Keysight N9000B CXA**

   - **Signal Hound BB60C**

- **Pros**: Offers detailed visualization of all RF activity, including noise and non-WiFi signals.

### 2\. **Software-Defined Radio (SDR) Receiver**

- **What it does**: An SDR receiver like the **RTL-SDR** allows you to tune into and analyze various RF signals using a connected computer.

- **Recommended Models**:

   - RTL-SDR (budget option)

   - LimeSDR (more advanced)

   - HackRF One

- **Pros**: Affordable and flexible; integrates with software like GNU Radio or SDR# for detailed analysis.

### 3\. **Handheld RF Detectors**

- **What it does**: These devices scan RF frequencies and alert you to high levels of interference.

- **Recommended Models**:

   - Kestrel Handheld RF Analyzer

   - BriteScan RF Detector

- **Pros**: Portable and easy to use for quick detection.

### 4\. **EMF Detectors**

- **What it does**: Measures electromagnetic fields, which can sometimes be indicative of RF interference.

- **Recommended Models**:

   - Cornet ED88T

   - Trifield TF2

- **Pros**: Useful for identifying general electromagnetic interference sources.

### 5\. **Wi-Spy DBx with Chanalyzer**

- **What it does**: Although primarily a WiFi spectrum analyzer, it can detect other 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz RF signals, such as those from cordless phones, microwaves, and Bluetooth devices.

- **Pros**: User-friendly and specifically optimized for troubleshooting WiFi interference.

### 6\. **Oscilloscope with RF Probes**

- **What it does**: Provides raw signal waveforms for detailed analysis.

- **Pros**: Advanced troubleshooting; useful if you need to analyze signal modulation or frequency.

### How to Use These Tools

1. **Scan Broad Frequencies**: Start with a wide-spectrum scan to locate any peaks or unusual activity.

2. **Focus on WiFi Bands**: Concentrate on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands if WiFi interference is suspected.

3. **Identify the Source**: Use directional antennas or adjust settings to pinpoint the physical location of the interference.
