# Llamafile 

<https://llamafile.ai/>

**llamafile lets you distribute and run LLMs with a single file. (++[announcement blog post](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2023/11/introducing-llamafile/)++)**

Our goal is to make open source large language models much more accessible to both developers and end users. We're doing that by combining ++[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)++ with ++[Cosmopolitan Libc](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan)++into one framework that collapses all the complexity of LLMs down to a single-file executable (called a "llamafile") that runs locally on most computers, with no installation.
