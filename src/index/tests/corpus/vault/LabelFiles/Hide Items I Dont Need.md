# Hide Items I Dont Need

Is a:: use case

## Computer Focus

Increases [Complexity Management.md](./Complexity%20Management.md) by:

1. reducing focus requirements during times of focus-need, narrowing the focus to just what’s required to engage in that focus-demanding activity (in this case, working on some open loop Computer thing)

   1. This is accomplished by hiding distracting elements (like browser tabs and open application windows)b

2. reducing distraction in time of typical focus need. Knowing I’ve delegated complexity to a trusted focus controller, I can remove clutter when its encountered knowing that I am not impacting $some activity

Improves Cognitive Efficiency and [Time Efficiency.md](./Time%20Efficiency.md) by:

1. no longer requiring that I spend time going through old open tabs and open apps and files, given I’ve delegated that responsibility. This is a task that I dislike and avoid.

Improves [Emotional Efficiency.md](./Emotional%20Efficiency.md) by:

1. No longer requiring that I deploy [Harmful Avoidance Tactics.md](./Harmful%20Avoidance%20Tactics.md) to manage the anxiety the mentioned task pushes into my body

Examples

- I have too many apps (documents, tabs) open, but I am afraid to close some of them in fear of losing something important. This gives me instant heebeejeebees when opening my laptop, which I can optionally avoid by fleeing to TikTok and keeping the laptop closed thereby missing out on fun things like writing code or playing a game.

## Effort Focus

- I have too many open loops and do not know what to focus on today - right now

- I have too many tasks in my task list, and i get lost in [Relentless Categorization (Problem).md](./Relentless%20Categorization%20\(Problem\).md)
