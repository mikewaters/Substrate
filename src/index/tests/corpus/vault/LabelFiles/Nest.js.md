Backend app framework in js

> Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports **[TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)** (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript)

> Nest provides an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows developers and teams to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable applications. The architecture is heavily inspired by Angular.
