# “Verticals” view (all evolving efforts, time series)

Provides Planning and Historical time series data

Consider a cell matrix where each row is an Effort. and where rows indicate some progress or maturity left to right.

Examples:

- Backing up my audiobooks

Efforts can be hierarchical, but  [The Problem with Hierarchies.md](./The%20Problem%20with%20Hierarchies.md) is they can be arbitrary, especially when being created from the bottom-up.

Example:

- Backing up our content

   - Backing up my audiobooks

      - … from audible

      - … from Books.app

Each row here is a fine-grained effort that:

1. Is attached to some desired outcome (and can be related to it in the artifact)

2. It may change over some timescale, perhaps indefinitely

   1. Might **evolve** over time, or instead can be solved at once.

   2. It may instead **iterate** - approaching the “solution” slowly

3. Can be assigned an importance/priority 

4. Should have a single location for information about status, future plans, history, references and resources.

   1. This can, in a PKM, be a Document or a part of some document

IRL, any item that isnt “solved” is one of [The Open Loops (Problem).md](./The%20Open%20Loops%20\(Problem\).md), and so we can benefit from offloading this information out of our brain.
