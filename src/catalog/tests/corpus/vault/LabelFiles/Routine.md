# Routine

Is a:: [Behavior.md](./Behavior.md)

A [Process.md](./Process.md) or other behavior that is repeated on some cadence.

Routines will eventually become somewhat habituated, assisting with my long-term goal of [Autopilot Scheduling.md](./Autopilot%20Scheduling.md). Unlike a [Habit.md](./Habit.md), however, the habituation is not the goal; instead, the goal is  have some rigor and consistency around life or professional work-product.

One can measure a dimension of success by how often their routines are adhered to.
