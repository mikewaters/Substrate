# Overstimulation

That meeting thing

##### Chronic stress and the nervous system 

People with ADHD are often in a **state of over-arousal, also known as hyperarousal.** This means that your nervous system  is constantly on overdrive and is more sensitive to environmental stimuli   . 

- **Exhaustion due to dysregulation:** The nervous system is either in a mode of overstimulation, which causes **chaos and distraction in the head** - or in the shutdown mode, which can manifest itself as **exhaustion and dreaminess** .
