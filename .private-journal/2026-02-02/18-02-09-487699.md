## Project Notes

The user confirmed the __main__ shutil.rmtree was the root cause of the dedup issue. They want to: 1) Delete IngestPipeline class entirely, keep only DatasetIngestPipeline 2) Fix __main__ (remove the DB wipe) 3) Get recommendations on how PersistenceTransform should play with LlamaIndex's docstore caching. The user is open to architectural suggestions here.
