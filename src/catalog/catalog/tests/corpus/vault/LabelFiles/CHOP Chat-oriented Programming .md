> chat-oriented programming, and can be classified as coding via iterative prompt refinement.

> Any questions we have about our codebase we can just ask Cody and get personalized answers based on our codebase. We can easily ask follow-up questions to learn more.

> allows you to ask questions about any open source repository that Sourcegraph has indexed on its public search instance located at **<https://sourcegraph.com/search>**.

> With CHOP, writing code is more like having a collaborative painting session with a skilled artist. You commission a painting (your initial prompt), and the AI coding assistant fills in the details, suggests improvements, and even offers alternative approaches. You can ask for specific code snippets to be generated, refactors to existing code, or even generate entire functions by clearly stating what your desired end goal is.

> You ask the AI coding assistant to complete tasks, it does it, you review the changes and accept them, or if the generated code isn't what you want, ask for a revision. In this case you are essentially acting as the code reviewer while the AI coding assistant is active as the programmer.

> With chat-oriented programming, the AI coding assistant is your rubber duck. 

## with Cody

> You can use Cody to identify potential problems, suggest improvements, write unit tests, and refactor code to match your guidelines … Find Code Smells

> Guardrails works by verifying code suggested by Cody against a large corpus of public code. Cody runs this verification check any time it generates a code snippet of 10 lines or more.

Cody has a lot of options, for tinkerers like the model
