# A Structure for Describing Work

> This document defines the Taxonomy of Work Doing, in the Work [Domain Models.md](./Domain%20Models.md).

From my personal [Vision.md](./Vision.md), or [Problem.md](./Problem.md)s I’m trying to address, down to tasks added to a todo list, I am defining the way [Work.md](./Work.md) should be described. 

Different types of Work may be described uniquely; for example for development work I will use terms like Epic/Feature/Story , but this doesn’t make sense for every kind of life-effort.

## Goal Alignment

### Strategy

For a Goal or group of related goals, I define Objectives, as well as a strategy for achieving those objectives in satisfaction of the goal. This is Strategy, and might be analogous to the Portfolio in PMO.

A strategy does not need to be super high level, attached to serious life goals; it could be related to finances, diet, or just anything that isn’t the way I want it to be.

### Solution

The outcomes of this strategy, which would individually align with a Program in PMO, I am calling Solutions. Each solution alone or grouped with another solution would be the achievement of one or more objective.

A solution may be PMO related in that its a software application that I develop - which fits nicely into PMO - but it would be something different like a new habit, behavior change, life change etc.

### Effort/Project

A Solution itself can be composed of multiple individual efforts, which I am calling Projects, but may instead just use the term Effort and be flexible with the subtypes.

Elements of work here can be documented within this structure.

## Documents

### Strategy

Template and description; [Portfolio aka Strategy Definition Document.md](./Portfolio%20aka%20Strategy%20Definition%20Document.md)

Examples:

- [LifeOS Strategy.md](./LifeOS%20Strategy.md)

   - This describes a very high level strategy, attached to a personal vision statement. 

### Solution

Template and description: [Solution Definition Document.md](./Solution%20Definition%20Document.md)

Examples:

- [Knowledge Manager.md](./Knowledge%20Manager.md)

- [Life Manager.md](./Life%20Manager.md)

## Hierarchy

The hierarchy of Work definition might look like this:

- Strategy X

   - Solution A

      - Project

      - Project

   - Solution B 

      - Project
