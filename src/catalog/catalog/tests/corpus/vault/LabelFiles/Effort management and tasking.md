# Effort management and tasking

Given our goals and outcomes, they are broken down into efforts which may be scheduled for the future or important enough to be worked on now.

Components:

1. a backlog of efforts

2. plans that express the completion of those efforts in how they relate to wider goals

3. those efforts, broken down into tasks (fully or partially)

4. those efforts that are in-scope

### Planning, tasking, and work management

- Plans (Heptabase)

   - I need something with time-based visualizations like gantt

- Area-specific backlogs

   - Current “season”

   - Next season

   - Future seasons

   - ex: Home and Property

### Efforts with a priority or recency component

- Current Outcomes/Themes/Goals of Importance

   - At a very high level:

      - What am I paying attention to?

      - What's important in my life at this moment?

      This sets the priority for choosing what's Important

      Important data:

      - Investment %

      - Or relative priority (how much??)

      Best case scenario, all the current outcomes should be viewable, and i can toggle how much to invest in each.

- Important or urgent work (efforts), planned or unplanned

   - What stuff is on my plate to execute on for the week?
