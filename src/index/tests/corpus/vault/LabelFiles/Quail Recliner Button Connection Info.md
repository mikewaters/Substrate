There are [other](https://lifeeasysupply.com/products/mot-ts-49l-kdh101b-304-2-button-switch-for-recliner-lift-chair-with-usb) options, for example with[ USB power](https://couchguard.com.au/product/usb-recliner-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoopC_V13iD57bwo2QtJZSrZUKuV_w2jTgLsd89dCawSTsH0Fv8J).

Connector is inside of the couch, and is a [5-pin DIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_connector), and per product pics there is a keyed slot at the connector. Other similar DIN connectors have different keyings. [MIDI](https://www.amazon.com/GLHONG-Extension-Keyboard-Synthesizer-Electric/dp/B09V7QJMNH/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2PU20MMJ2DBUX&sprefix=5-pin%2Bdin%2Bextension%2Bcable%2Caps%2C162&sr=8-4&th=1) and older AT Keyboard cables use 5-pin DIN in this pinout, unsure if the keyway will match though.

The particular pin spec appears to be:

> DIN 41524 / IEC/DIN EN 60130-9 types IEC-03 and IEC-04: five-pin, 45°, 180°

The pinout can be found [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/DIN_connector_pinout.svg) (1, 4, 2, 5, 3 from left to right).

## Doing …

Jan 18, 2025 Buying a remote control from some assistive recliner device, it looks like it will fit and has a much much longer cable.  If this works, I’ll then try to re-mount the original switch using a 5-pin DIN splitter cable to allow both to function. Which may not work…
