# **Determine HVAC Exhaust Fan Airflow**

To accurately test a bathroom exhaust fan, several tools and methods can be employed to ensure it is functioning properly and efficiently:

## Essential Tools

1. **Anemometer**: This device measures the air velocity in the duct. By calculating the average airspeed and multiplying it by the duct's cross-sectional area, you can determine the airflow in cubic feet per minute (CFM)\[4\]\[8\].

2. **Air Balancing Hood**: This tool is used to measure the airflow directly at the grille. It captures all the fan airflow and provides a reading, which can be compared to the fan's specifications\[4\]\[8\].

3. **Manometer**: Used to measure the static pressure in the duct. This is important for understanding the fan's operating conditions and comparing them to manufacturer specifications\[8\].

4. **Multimeter**: Useful for checking electrical connections, ensuring the fan is receiving power, and diagnosing any electrical issues\[3\].

5. **Smoke Puffer**: Helps visualize airflow by releasing smoke near the fan. If the smoke is drawn into the fan, it indicates that the fan is moving air\[5\]\[6\].

## Common Testing Methods

- **Toilet Paper Test**: A simple method where a sheet of toilet paper is held up to the fan. If the fan can hold the paper against the grille, it indicates that the fan is drawing air\[1\]\[2\]\[5\].

- **Airflow Traverse**: Involves drilling small test holes in the duct and using an anemometer to measure air velocity at multiple points. This method provides an average airspeed for calculating airflow\[4\]\[8\].

- **Flow Hood Measurement**: Place a flow hood over the fan grille to measure the exhaust airflow directly. This method is straightforward and provides a direct measurement of airflow\[6\]\[8\].

By using these tools and methods, you can accurately assess the performance of a bathroom exhaust fan, ensuring it meets the necessary ventilation requirements and operates efficiently.

There are a bunch of specifications about exhaust fan airflow rights. Before you can figure out if you are in spec, you need an easy and practical way to determine [HVAC exhaust fan airflow](https://www.brooklynfan.com/)in the field.

First, you want to locate the exhaust fan. It is located at the start of the duct or the end of the duct? In a forced air system, the exhaust fan may be located in the middle of the duct.

While it is important to match the fan and the duct according to specifications, you cannot assume that a properly matched exhaust fan and duct will meet specifications.

## Common Ways to Measure Airflow

There are several different ways to measure airflow. We think these ways offer the most practical solutions for measuring actual airflow in the field.

- • Airflow Traverse

- • Plot Fan Airflow

- • Air Balancing Hood Measurement

## Air Balancing Hood Measurement

If you have a grille that is flat against a ceiling of wall, you can place an air balancing hood securely over the grille. Make sure you are capturing all of the fan airflow. Then, set the balancing hood to read in exhaust mode. If the reading is within +/- 10% of the specified airflow, it is considered in spec.

## Airflow Traverse

More complicated than using an air balancing hood, this method depends on you getting an accurate average air speed in the duct. You drill small test holes at different places along the duct. You use an anemometer to measure the air velocity at each location in the duct. Then, determine the average air speed. Use the average speed and multiply it by the area of the full length of the duct. The result is the exhaust air flow.

## Plot Fan Airflow

To determine this, you need to consult the manufacturer’s fan performance table. Measure the fan’s operating static pressure and the revolutions per minute. You can measure revolutions per minute using a non-contact tachometer and the fan static pressure using a manometer (pressure gauge) with a static pressure tip attached to a hose or a tube. Drill a test hole in the duct and measure pressure at the test hole. Use the table to plot the fan’s airflow.
