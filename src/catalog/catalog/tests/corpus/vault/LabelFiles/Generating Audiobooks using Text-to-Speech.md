| Cool. Maybe you'd like to take a look at F5-TTS, where you can upload a voice sample to "clone" a narrator voice, e.g.
 https://github.com/JarodMica/audiobook_maker
Here is a video about it:

With gradio and F5-TTS it is also possible to train your own voice by Speech-To-Text via Whisper and after this train your model to use the generated LJSpeech dataset to train your own voice model for F5-TTS. Video:

This way you basically can take any audio book with your favourite narrator, clone his voice and let him read ANY of your epubs. Even more, you could use F5-TTS extensions to use different voices e.g. for female and male characters:

  {male} What's up?
  {female} Nothing.
  {male} Ok
  {narrator} After this they both hung up the phone.


But you'd probably need a pretty decent GPU to get this going :-)
