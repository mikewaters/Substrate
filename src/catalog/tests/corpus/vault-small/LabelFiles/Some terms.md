# Some terms

Let me break this down carefully.

"In the limit" and "in aggregate" are mathematical and analytical concepts that come from different but related domains:

"In the limit" comes from calculus and mathematical analysis. It describes behavior as some quantity approaches infinity or a specific value. For example:

- The limit of 1/n as n approaches infinity is 0

- The limiting behavior of a pendulum's oscillations as friction gradually reduces its swing

- The asymptotic behavior of an algorithm as input size grows very large

"In aggregate" comes from statistics and economics. It refers to viewing data or phenomena as a collected whole rather than as individual instances. For example:

- Looking at total GDP rather than individual transactions

- Studying population-level health outcomes rather than individual cases

- Analyzing overall market trends rather than single stock movements

These terms are part of a broader ontology of mathematical and systems thinking that includes concepts like:

"At equilibrium" - from physics and economics, describing stable states of systems
"On average" - from statistics, describing central tendencies
"At steady state" - from dynamical systems, describing stable long-term behavior
"In expectation" - from probability theory, describing anticipated outcomes
"Asymptotically" - from complexity theory, describing ultimate scaling behavior
"In the long run" - from economics and game theory, describing eventual outcomes
"In principle" - from philosophy, describing theoretical rather than practical possibilities

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these concepts or provide more specific examples of their usage?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
