# Mac Mini Ideas

Todo:

- [x] How can I run systemd-like services while still allowing a user login session? Or multiple users?

- [ ] Choose a local service runner for the Mac Mini (Podman etc)

## Infra or hardware

- Want to upgrade the SSD at some point, before I install too many things

- Need a fast local net to connect to my NAS and MacBook

- ~~Need to install the UPS and power conditioning~~

## Services to run

- I need a local container hosting platform, I am thinking Podman or k3s.

## Local hosting

- Local Inference, like Ollama or something

- LiteLLM [ML Provider Proxies.md](./ML%20Provider%20Proxies.md)

- n8n

- agents in different stacks, so I can experiment but also do useful shit. I should be able to invoke these from n8n
