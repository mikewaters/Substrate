## oEmbed format

Open format for cross-page embedding, its how (for example) Twitter posts can be embedded in a website. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OEmbed)

This can be used to grab youtube or other videos from a page or from an RSS feed.

From [oembed.com](https://oembed.com)

> oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites. The simple API allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, without having to parse the resource directly.
