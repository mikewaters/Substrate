# MCT Oil

C8 MCT oil refers to a specific type of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil that consists primarily of caprylic acid (C8:0), an 8-carbon fatty acid. MCT oils are derived from natural sources like coconut oil or palm kernel oil and are valued for their quick energy conversion and ketogenic benefits.

Characteristics of C8 MCT Oil:
1\.	Rapid Energy Source: C8 is the most efficiently metabolized MCT, quickly converting into ketones for energy without requiring digestion in the liver.
2\.	Cognitive Benefits: Ketones from C8 may enhance mental clarity and focus, making it popular among people on ketogenic diets.
3\.	Gut Health: C8 is easier to digest than other MCTs and may have antimicrobial properties.

Other Types of MCT Oil:

MCT oil can contain a mix of the following fatty acids:
1\.	C6 (Caproic Acid):
•	Very short-chain (6 carbons).
•	Converts to energy quickly but has a strong, unpleasant taste and odor, so it’s less commonly isolated.
2\.	C8 (Caprylic Acid):
•	The fastest to convert into energy.
•	Ideal for those seeking rapid ketone production.
3\.	C10 (Capric Acid):
•	Slightly slower energy conversion than C8.
•	More affordable and commonly blended with C8 in MCT oils.
4\.	C12 (Lauric Acid):
•	Technically an MCT, but behaves more like a long-chain triglyceride (LCT).
•	Found abundantly in coconut oil and has antimicrobial benefits, though it converts to energy more slowly.

Types of MCT Oil Products:
1\.	Pure C8 MCT Oil:
•	Ideal for rapid energy and ketosis.
•	Generally more expensive.
2\.	C8/C10 Blends:
•	The most common type of MCT oil.
•	A balance of cost-effectiveness and efficiency.
3\.	Full-Spectrum MCT Oil:
•	Contains a mix of C6, C8, C10, and C12.
•	Often less expensive but less focused on rapid ketone production.
4\.	Powdered MCT Oil:
•	MCT oil mixed with a carrier (like tapioca fiber).
•	Convenient for adding to coffee or smoothies.
5\.	Coconut Oil:
•	Naturally contains MCTs (primarily C12) but in smaller concentrations than refined MCT oils.

Choosing the Right MCT Oil:
•	For quick energy or ketogenic diets: C8 or C8/C10 blends.
•	For general health benefits: Full-spectrum MCT oil or coconut oil.
•	For convenience: Powdered MCT oil.

For a skin care product designed to deliver chemicals transdermally (into the bloodstream through the skin), **C8 (caprylic acid)** and **C10 (capric acid)** are the best MCT oil fatty acid types, as they have the following beneficial properties:



**Why C8 and C10 Are Best for Transdermal Applications**

1\. **Molecular Size and Absorption**:

• Both C8 and C10 are medium-chain triglycerides with small molecular sizes, allowing for better skin penetration compared to longer-chain fatty acids like C12 (lauric acid).

• C8 is particularly effective due to its smaller size and higher lipophilicity, which enhances penetration into the skin barrier.

2\. **Carrier Properties**:

• C8 and C10 are excellent carriers for active ingredients due to their non-greasy, lightweight texture.

• They help dissolve and stabilize lipophilic (fat-soluble) compounds, making the active ingredient more bioavailable for transdermal delivery.

3\. **Non-Comedogenic and Skin-Friendly**:

• These MCTs are gentle on the skin and less likely to clog pores or cause irritation, making them suitable for various skin types.

4\. **Enhanced Absorption**:

• Both fatty acids can improve the solubility and skin permeability of certain active ingredients, enhancing their absorption into the bloodstream.



**Fatty Acids Less Suited for Transdermal Delivery:**

1\. **C6 (caproic acid)**:

• It penetrates well but has a strong odor and can irritate the skin, making it less practical for skincare.

2\. **C12 (lauric acid)**:

• Although antimicrobial, its longer chain length limits its ability to penetrate deeply into the skin.



**Key Considerations:**

• **Formulation Synergy**: MCT oils work well when combined with other penetration enhancers (like dimethyl sulfoxide or certain alcohols) to further improve transdermal delivery.

• **Stability**: Choose high-quality, fractionated MCT oils (purified forms of C8 and C10) to ensure stability and avoid impurities.



In summary, **C8 MCT oil** is the most effective for transdermal delivery, with **C10 MCT oil** being a solid alternative. 

# penetration

To facilitate transdermal penetration of compounds in **C8** or **C10 MCT oils**, you can add specific **penetration enhancers**. These substances help the active compound bypass the skin’s outer barrier (stratum corneum) and improve absorption into the bloodstream.

## for rso

RSO (Rick Simpson Oil) is a cannabis extract that is highly lipophilic (fat-soluble) because its primary active compounds, cannabinoids (e.g., THC, CBD), are hydrophobic and dissolve readily in oils and nonpolar solvents. This means it will pair well with carriers and penetration enhancers designed for lipophilic compounds.

Recommended Penetrants for Transdermal Delivery of RSO:

To effectively deliver RSO transdermally, you need a combination of lipid-soluble carriers and penetration enhancers that disrupt the skin barrier and facilitate absorption into deeper layers or the bloodstream.

1. Carrier Base: C8 or C10 MCT Oil
   •	Why: MCT oil (especially C8) is an ideal carrier because it is lightweight, non-greasy, and excellent at solubilizing cannabinoids. It enhances skin permeability and improves the bioavailability of lipophilic compounds.
   •	How: Use MCT oil as the base to dilute and stabilize the RSO.

2. Penetration Enhancers:

The following enhancers are recommended for RSO due to its lipophilic nature:

a. Oleic Acid:
•	Why: Oleic acid disrupts the lipid bilayers in the skin, enhancing penetration of lipophilic compounds like cannabinoids.
•	Usage: Combine a small percentage (e.g., 5-10%) with the MCT oil and RSO.

b. Ethanol:
•	Why: Ethanol temporarily disrupts the stratum corneum and increases the solubility of cannabinoids, allowing deeper penetration.
•	Usage: Use ethanol as a cosolvent with MCT oil and RSO (up to 20%, depending on skin tolerance).

c. Isopropyl Myristate (IPM):
•	Why: IPM enhances skin penetration by increasing lipid solubility and providing a silky, non-greasy feel.
•	Usage: Add 5-10% to the formulation.

d. Terpenes:
•	Why: Terpenes such as limonene or myrcene are natural penetration enhancers that work synergistically with cannabinoids.
•	Usage: Add 1-2% of a terpene like limonene to the formulation for increased absorption.

e. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO):
•	Why: DMSO is one of the most effective transdermal penetration enhancers, allowing deep delivery into the bloodstream.
•	Caution: DMSO carries everything it contacts into the skin, so it must be used with high-purity ingredients to avoid introducing contaminants.
•	Usage: Use in very low concentrations (5-10%) to avoid irritation.

1. Hydration Enhancers:

Hydrating the skin makes it more permeable, allowing better absorption of cannabinoids.
•	Glycerin: Softens and hydrates the stratum corneum.
•	Propylene Glycol: Improves solubility and skin penetration.

Example Formulations:

Mild Formula for Sensitive Skin:
•	C8 MCT oil: 80%
•	Oleic acid: 5%
•	Propylene glycol: 10%
•	RSO: 5%

High-Efficacy Formula:
•	C8 MCT oil: 70%
•	Ethanol: 15%
•	Isopropyl myristate: 10%
•	RSO: 5%

Advanced Penetration Formula:
•	C8 MCT oil: 65%
•	DMSO: 10%
•	Terpenes (e.g., limonene): 2%
•	RSO: 5%
•	Oleic acid: 5%
•	Glycerin: 13%

Key Considerations:
1\.	Skin Sensitivity: Start with lower concentrations of penetration enhancers to avoid irritation.
2\.	Area of Application: Apply to thinner, vascularized skin (e.g., inner wrist, behind the ear) for better absorption.
3\.	RSO Purity: Ensure the RSO is free of impurities and safe for transdermal use, as contaminants can be absorbed into the bloodstream.

# combining penetrants

Yes, there are some penetrants that should not be combined for transdermal delivery of lipophilic substances like RSO. Certain combinations can either reduce efficacy, cause irritation, or introduce undesirable interactions.

Key Concerns:
1\.	Protein Denaturation:
•	Isopropyl Alcohol and Ethanol:
•	These alcohols can denature skin proteins and disrupt the lipid bilayer, but in excess or combined with harsh enhancers (like DMSO), they may overstrip the skin, causing irritation or compromising the barrier function.
•	Avoid using high concentrations (>20%) of alcohols in combination with other potent disruptors like DMSO or terpenes, as this can lead to skin damage.
2\.	Excessive Lipid Disruption:
•	Combining oleic acid, isopropyl myristate (IPM), and ethanol can overly disrupt the lipid bilayer, leading to excessive absorption or irritation.
•	These should be balanced in the formulation to avoid over-penetration or local toxicity.
3\.	Chemical Interaction with RSO:
•	Highly Reactive Compounds:
•	RSO contains cannabinoids, which are chemically stable but can degrade when exposed to strong acids, bases, or oxidizers. Avoid combining with reactive chemicals like strong peroxides or aggressive surfactants.
4\.	Irritation Amplification:
•	DMSO + Alcohols:
•	DMSO is a strong penetration enhancer and, when combined with ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, can cause significant irritation or burning sensations on the skin.
•	DMSO + Terpenes:
•	Both are powerful enhancers, and their combination may lead to over-penetration and increased irritation.
5\.	Unwanted Carry-Through:
•	DMSO is unique in that it can carry nearly anything on the skin into the bloodstream. Combining it with substances like preservatives, fragrances, or contaminants (e.g., low-purity alcohols) is dangerous, as it may transport harmful compounds.
6\.	Hydration vs. Barrier Function:
•	Hydration Enhancers (e.g., glycerin) with alcohols:
•	Glycerin helps retain moisture, while alcohols are drying agents. Using them in high concentrations together may counteract each other’s effects or lead to uneven skin barrier disruption.

Recommendations for RSO Transdermal Delivery:

Combinations to Avoid:
1\.	High Alcohol Content + DMSO:
•	Can cause irritation, burning, and unwanted carry-through of impurities.
2\.	Oleic Acid + Isopropyl Myristate in High Doses:
•	Over-disrupts skin lipids, risking irritation and uncontrolled absorption.
3\.	DMSO + Reactive or Impure Ingredients:
•	Avoid pairing with preservatives, fragrances, or other non-essential compounds.

Best Practices for Safe and Effective Delivery:
1\.	Use one strong penetration enhancer (e.g., DMSO or ethanol) with gentler carriers (e.g., C8 MCT oil).
2\.	Limit alcohol concentration to <20% to avoid protein denaturation and excessive irritation.
3\.	Opt for skin-compatible enhancers like oleic acid, isopropyl myristate, or terpenes, but balance their proportions to avoid over-disruption.
4\.	Avoid combining too many strong penetration enhancers in one formulation.

• Some of these compounds are toxic or irritating to the skin, and others may cause systemic toxicity if they enter the bloodstream.

2\. **Unpredictable Absorption**:

• Transdermal formulations aim to deliver active ingredients into the bloodstream. Using denatured ethanol risks carrying the toxic additives along with the active ingredient.

3\. **Legal and Safety Regulations**:

• Denatured ethanol is not approved for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, or transdermal use. Regulatory bodies like the FDA require ethanol used in such products to be **USP grade (United States Pharmacopeia)**, which is free of harmful additives.



**What to Use Instead**

1\. **USP-Grade Ethanol (Pure Ethanol)**:

• Safe for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications.

• Readily available as **pharmaceutical-grade alcohol** or **food-grade ethanol** (e.g., Everclear).

2\. **Ethanol Alternatives**:

• If ethanol is unavailable or undesirable, you can use **isopropyl alcohol (IPA)** in low concentrations (<10%), but IPA is less common in transdermal formulations due to its drying effect and potential irritation.



**Recommended Ethanol Sourcing**

• **Food-Grade Ethanol (190 Proof)**:

• Examples: Everclear or similar grain alcohols.

• Safe, effective, and widely used in cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications.

• **Pharmaceutical-Grade Ethanol**:

• Available through suppliers specializing in cosmetic or medical-grade ingredients.

• Ensure the ethanol is certified **USP-grade** or equivalent.



**Key Safety Considerations**

1\. **Avoid Additives**:

• Always check the purity of the ethanol to ensure no additives or denaturants are present.

2\. **Storage**:

• Ethanol is volatile and flammable; store in a cool, well-ventilated area away from open flames.

3\. **Skin Sensitivity**:

• Ethanol can dry and irritate the skin at higher concentrations. Use in moderation (<20%) and balance with hydrators like glycerin or propylene glycol.



In summary, **denatured ethanol should not be used** in transdermal formulations. Stick to **USP-grade or food-grade ethanol** to ensure safety and efficacy. Let me know if you’d like sourcing tips or adjustments to your formulation!

## decarboxylation

**Decarboxylation of cannabis** is crucial for transdermal products if the goal is to deliver active cannabinoids (like **THC** or **CBD**) into the bloodstream for systemic effects. Here’s why it matters and how it impacts transdermal absorption:



**Why Decarboxylation is Important**

1\. **Activation of Cannabinoids**:

• **Raw cannabinoids** (e.g., THCA and CBDA) in cannabis are in their **acidic forms** and must be decarboxylated to convert into their active forms (THC and CBD) to interact with cannabinoid receptors in the body.

• Without decarboxylation, THCA and CBDA have minimal psychoactive or therapeutic effects.

2\. **Systemic Effects Require Active Cannabinoids**:

• If the balm is designed to deliver cannabinoids into the bloodstream for effects like pain relief, mood enhancement, or other therapeutic benefits, the cannabinoids must be in their **active form** (THC, CBD, etc.).

• THCA and CBDA have limited bioavailability and are not metabolized into their active forms during transdermal absorption.

3\. **First-Pass Metabolism Bypass**:

• Transdermal delivery avoids the digestive system, meaning there is no heat or metabolic process in the liver to convert THCA to THC. Decarboxylation before formulating the balm ensures the cannabinoids are already in their active state.



**When Decarboxylation May Not Be Necessary**

1\. **Non-Systemic Effects**:

• If the balm is designed for **localized effects** (e.g., anti-inflammatory or antioxidant properties) rather than systemic, non-decarboxylated cannabinoids like THCA and CBDA may still provide therapeutic benefits.

2\. **Specific THCA/CBDA Benefits**:

• THCA and CBDA have distinct properties (e.g., anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective) that some users may prefer. In such cases, decarboxylation can be skipped.



**How to Decarboxylate Cannabis for Transdermal Use**

1\. **Pre-Decarboxylated RSO**:

• Most commercially available RSO is already decarboxylated. Check with your supplier.

2\. **DIY Decarboxylation**:

• If working with raw cannabis, decarboxylate it before making RSO or the balm.

• **Process**:

• Preheat oven to **240°F (115°C)**.

• Grind cannabis evenly and spread it on a baking sheet.

• Heat for **30-40 minutes** (depending on the moisture content) to activate cannabinoids.

• Use this material to prepare RSO or directly incorporate it into the formulation.



**Summary**

• **Decarboxylation is critical** for systemic effects because active cannabinoids (THC, CBD) are necessary for therapeutic interaction with the body.

• For localized effects, raw cannabinoids (THCA, CBDA) may still be effective.

• Always decarboxylate your cannabis if systemic cannabinoid effects (e.g., psychoactivity, full therapeutic action) are desired.



**Additional solvents or excipients** are often beneficial to ensure **RSO** is effective for transdermal absorption. While RSO itself is already a highly concentrated cannabis extract, its viscosity and cannabinoid solubility can limit its ability to penetrate the skin barrier efficiently. Adding solvents and penetration enhancers can optimize the delivery of cannabinoids into the bloodstream.



**Why Additional Solvents Are Useful**

1\. **Improving Cannabinoid Solubility**:

• Cannabinoids like THC and CBD are lipophilic (fat-soluble) and dissolve well in oils. However, the skin barrier (stratum corneum) is designed to resist both water and oil penetration.

• Solvents can help dissolve the cannabinoids into a form that can penetrate more easily.

2\. **Reducing Viscosity**:

• RSO is highly viscous, which can hinder even application and absorption. Solvents reduce viscosity, improving spreadability and uniform delivery.

3\. **Enhancing Penetration**:

• Additional solvents and excipients disrupt the skin barrier or improve diffusion into deeper layers.



**Recommended Solvents for Transdermal RSO**



**1\. Ethanol:**

• **Role**: Ethanol acts as a cosolvent that increases the solubility of cannabinoids and temporarily disrupts the stratum corneum, enhancing absorption.

• **Concentration**: 5–15%.

• **Notes**: Use **USP-grade ethanol**; avoid denatured ethanol.



**2\. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO):**

• **Role**: A powerful penetration enhancer that facilitates the transport of cannabinoids through the skin into the bloodstream.

• **Concentration**: 5–10%.

• **Notes**: Use pharmaceutical-grade DMSO, as it carries all compounds (including contaminants) into the bloodstream.



**3\. Oleic Acid:**

• **Role**: Disrupts lipid bilayers in the skin, enhancing cannabinoid penetration.

• **Concentration**: 3–5%.

• **Notes**: Works well in oil-based formulations.



**4\. Propylene Glycol:**

• **Role**: A solvent that hydrates the skin and improves solubility and diffusion of cannabinoids.

• **Concentration**: 5–10%.

• **Notes**: Use in conjunction with other solvents like ethanol for synergistic effects.



**5\. Limonene (Terpene Solvent):**

• **Role**: A natural terpene that acts as a penetration enhancer while synergizing with cannabinoids.

• **Concentration**: 1–3%.

• **Notes**: Adds a pleasant citrus scent but can cause irritation in high concentrations.



**6\. PEG-400 (Polyethylene Glycol):**

• **Role**: Improves solubility and diffusion of cannabinoids while reducing viscosity.

• **Concentration**: 5–15%.

• **Notes**: Ideal for more stable formulations with mixed solubility.



**Combining Solvents in Formulations**



Combining solvents improves absorption by targeting different mechanisms:

• **Ethanol + Oleic Acid**: Ethanol disrupts skin proteins, and oleic acid disrupts lipids, creating a synergistic penetration-enhancing effect.

• **DMSO + Propylene Glycol**: DMSO facilitates deep penetration, while propylene glycol keeps the skin hydrated to reduce irritation.

• **Ethanol + PEG-400**: Ethanol solubilizes cannabinoids and facilitates penetration, while PEG-400 stabilizes the formulation and improves spreadability.



**Example Transdermal Formulation with Solvents**



For a **100g batch**:

• **RSO (Active Cannabinoid Source)**: 20g

• **C8 MCT Oil (Primary Carrier)**: 50g

• **Ethanol (Penetration Enhancer)**: 10g

• **DMSO (Deep Penetrant)**: 10g

• **Oleic Acid (Lipid Disruptor)**: 5g

• **Limonene (Terpene Solvent)**: 2g

• **Glycerin (Hydrator)**: 3g



**Safety Considerations**

1\. **Ingredient Purity**:

• Use pharmaceutical- or cosmetic-grade solvents to avoid introducing contaminants into the bloodstream.

2\. **Concentration Control**:

• Excessive concentrations of some solvents (e.g., ethanol, DMSO) can cause irritation or over-penetration.

3\. **Patch Testing**:

• Always conduct a patch test on a small area of skin to assess tolerance.



**Conclusion**



While RSO contains potent cannabinoids, adding solvents like ethanol, DMSO, or oleic acid is critical for enhancing its transdermal absorption. These ingredients ensure the cannabinoids penetrate deeply, reach the bloodstream efficiently, and achieve systemic effects. Let me know if you’d like a more customized formulation!



## excipients

In the context of **transdermal formulations** (like your RSO balm), an **excipient** refers to any inactive substance added to the formulation to serve a specific purpose beyond being the active ingredient. Excipients are used to enhance the product’s **stability, absorption, texture, or usability**.



**Roles of Excipients in Transdermal Products**

1\. **Carriers**:

• Help dissolve, dilute, or stabilize the active ingredient (RSO) for uniform application.

• Example: **C8 MCT oil** dissolves cannabinoids and makes them easier to spread.

2\. **Penetration Enhancers**:

• Facilitate the delivery of active ingredients through the skin by altering the stratum corneum or improving diffusion.

• Example: **DMSO**, **ethanol**, **oleic acid**.

3\. **Emulsifiers**:

• Stabilize mixtures of oil and water (or viscous substances like RSO and MCT oil) to ensure consistent distribution.

• Example: **Sunflower lecithin**, **polysorbate 80**.

4\. **Hydrators**:

• Increase skin hydration to soften the outer skin layers, making it easier for the active ingredient to penetrate.

• Example: **Glycerin**, **propylene glycol**.

5\. **Stabilizers**:

• Prevent separation or degradation of the formulation over time.

• Example: **PEG-400** ensures uniform viscosity and stability.

6\. **Texturizers**:

• Improve the product’s feel, making it more pleasant to apply.

• Example: **Beeswax** in a balm adds body and smoothness.



**Why Excipients Are Important**



Excipients ensure the **effectiveness, safety, and usability** of the transdermal formulation. For example:

• Without a **penetration enhancer** like ethanol or DMSO, cannabinoids might not reach the bloodstream effectively.

• Without a **carrier** like MCT oil, RSO would be too thick to apply evenly.

• Without a **hydrator** like glycerin, the formulation might dry out the skin, causing irritation.



In transdermal applications, excipients are not just “inactive” but play critical roles in enhancing the delivery and tolerability of the active ingredients.
