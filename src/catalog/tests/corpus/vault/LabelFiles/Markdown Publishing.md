# Markdown Publishing

Question: Should I publish my [Obsidian.md](./Obsidian.md) vault, thereby giving me the ability to add in web tech? Example: <https://notes.brie.dev>

### Material for MkDocs

> Documentation that simply works

> [squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/](squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

Open source

It appears that normal Mkdocs plugins are supported, which really opens this up.
