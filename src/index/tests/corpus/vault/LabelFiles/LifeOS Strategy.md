# LifeOS Strategy

+ ## Strategic Plan

   ### Vision Statement

   To properly operate my Life Business. 

   ### Problems addressed

   I am not capable of my current scale without assistive tools, which I do not have. No existing tools fit my mental model of the world, and the impedance mismatch is too much to bear.

   + How will I solve these problems?

      Collect data into a non-meat system.  The types of data that I need to offload are:

      1. Life-data

      2. Work

      3. Life-metrics

      4. Information and knowledge

      ++Life-data++

      Includes the following “Second Brain” types of information:

      - Memory augmentation:

         - what was that idea i had

         - what am I studying

         - what was that aoo I used for X

         - what are those keyboard shortcuts for Y

      - Reference:

         - what are my passwords

         - what are the things I am paying for

      - Self:

         - what are my goals, vision, values

         - what are my current problems and solutions

      ++Work data++

      - What is going on right now? 

      - How do I balance everything, and achieve my goals

      ++Life-metrics++

      - What was my wieght

      - where did i go last month

      - what did i watch

      ++Information and Knowledge++

      - All the things that I have found in the world, organized.

   ### Associated Goals

   - TBD

   ### Concrete Objectives

   - Create an effective knowledge management and memory augmentation/Second Brain system

      - information-at-rest

   - Create an effective work management system

      - information-in-flight

   - Collect life metrics in a quantified-self manner

   ### Solution Roadmap

   > Instructions: Approach the objectives as pillars of the same problem, which are solved by a single system, which should then be iterated on based on increments of the whole ratehr than independent increments of the parts.

   Proof of Concept, where I:

   1. Assemble and document a mental model for the LifeOS

   2. Assemble a walking skeleton solution using off the shelf tools

   3. Refine the requirements and principles for a LifeOS, to build a roadmap

   Stores life-data contextually (work, self, world etc)

   Solutions:

   1.  Entity Collector

      1. Input life-data

      2. Set life-data relationships

   2. Data/Entity Manager

      1. Visualize life-data and relationships

   3. Dashboard tool

      1. runbook of runbooks

      2. general memory aid

   Stores information contextually

   1. Information contextualizer

   2. Entity matcher

   > Builds on the life manager to provide a higher level capability.

   + why?

      1. Everything shut be put away (-able)

      2. **what's in front of your eyes is what should be in front of your eyes**.

      3. digital clearing of my desk so to speak

   - Surfaces information that’s needed and hides what isn’t, using the context
