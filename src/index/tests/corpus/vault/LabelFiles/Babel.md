# Babel

Babel is a JavaScript compiler, sort of. It doesn’t compile JavaScript the same way gcc compiles C++. Instead it compiles newer JavaScript into older JavaScript. Technically, it is a *transpiler.*

What this means you can write your JavaScript using the latest features the language has to offer and Babel will compile your code into JavaScript that will run without issues on most browsers, even if they don’t support the cutting edge standards. Specifically in the case of React, your code will be in JSX format, which of course is not a standard supported by browsers, and you’ll need Babel to compile it down to regular JavaScript.
