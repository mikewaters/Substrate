# Elastic, Rubber Band Storage

## Recommendations

- **consider switching to silicone rubber bands, which offer superior resistance to UV rays, moisture, and temperature fluctuations** compared to natural rubber bands\[12\].

- **Refrigerator storage significantly extends rubber band life** by keeping polymers in a relaxed state\[9\]\[10\].

- **Include desiccant packets in your storage containers** to absorb any residual moisture\[5\].

- **Store your rubber bands in airtight containers** 

- **Store rubber bands in completely opaque containers**

- **Keep storage containers away from any electrical equipment in the shed**, such as motors or electrical panels, as these can generate ozone that damages rubber\[1\]\[2\].

## Concerns

### Temperature

- hot temperatures accelerate oxidation

- cold temperatures make elastic brittle

- Refrigerated storage is optimal

> **extreme temperatures cause different types of degradation**—**cold temperatures make rubber bands brittle**, while **hot temperatures accelerate oxidation and make them soft**\[2\]\[3\]

> **Store rubber bands between 32°F and 72°F**

### Humidity

> **humidity should be kept below 75%**

### Air Contaminates

- oxygen and ozone

- plastic off-gassing

> oxygen and ozone exposure, which can cause **polymer chain breakdown**\[2\]

> **Avoid storing in plastic bags long-term**, as plastic can off-gas chemicals that attack natural rubber\[8\]

### UV

> **UV rays from sunlight are one of the primary causes of rubber degradation**, causing bands to become brittle and lose elasticity\[1\]\[6\]

### Constant tension

> Avoid hanging them on pegs or storing them under tension, as this accelerates degradation.

## maximize the lifespan of elastic or rubber bands

Perplexity

To maximize the lifespan of elastic or rubber bands in an unconditioned shed that experiences extreme temperature fluctuations, you'll need to create a protective storage environment that addresses the key factors that cause rubber degradation.

## Optimal Storage Temperature

**Store rubber bands between 32°F and 72°F when possible**\[1\]. Unfortunately, your shed will experience temperatures outside this range. While you can't control the shed's temperature, you can minimize damage by understanding that **extreme temperatures cause different types of degradation**—**cold temperatures make rubber bands brittle**, while **hot temperatures accelerate oxidation and make them soft**\[2\]\[3\].

## Essential Storage Container Requirements

### Use Airtight Containers

**Store your rubber bands in airtight containers to protect against moisture, dust, and contaminants**\[4\]. This is critical because **humidity should be kept below 75%** and **condensation should be avoided at all times**\[2\]. An airtight seal also protects against oxygen and ozone exposure, which can cause **polymer chain breakdown**\[2\].

### Add Moisture Control

**Include desiccant packets in your storage containers** to absorb any residual moisture\[5\]. This is particularly important given the hot, humid summer conditions in your shed.

## Protection from Environmental Factors

### Block All Light Exposure

**Store rubber bands in completely opaque containers and keep them in the darkest area of your shed**\[4\]\[1\]. **UV rays from sunlight are one of the primary causes of rubber degradation**, causing bands to become brittle and lose elasticity\[1\]\[6\]. Even reflected sunlight can damage rubber\[1\].

### Avoid Ozone Sources

**Keep storage containers away from any electrical equipment in the shed**, such as motors or electrical panels, as these can generate ozone that damages rubber\[1\]\[2\].

## Storage Method Best Practices

### Store in Relaxed State

**Keep rubber bands in their natural, unstretched position**\[2\]. Avoid hanging them on pegs or storing them under tension, as this accelerates degradation.

### Use Proper Containers

- **Food-grade plastic containers with tight-fitting lids** work well

- **Metal containers like cookie tins** can provide excellent protection\[7\]

- **Avoid storing in plastic bags long-term**, as plastic can off-gas chemicals that attack natural rubber\[8\]

### Consider Multiple Storage Locations

If possible, **keep a working supply in a more climate-controlled area** of your home and only store excess inventory in the shed. **Refrigerator storage significantly extends rubber band life** by keeping polymers in a relaxed state\[9\]\[10\].

## Special Considerations for Extreme Conditions

### Winter Preparation

**When temperatures drop below freezing, rubber bands will stiffen and become more prone to breaking**\[11\]. **Allow cold bands to gradually warm up before use** rather than immediately stretching them, as rapid temperature changes cause significant weakening\[9\].

### Summer Protection

During hot, humid periods, **ensure your airtight containers are completely sealed** and **check desiccant packets periodically** to ensure they're still absorbing moisture effectively.

## Material Alternatives

For the harshest storage conditions, **consider switching to silicone rubber bands, which offer superior resistance to UV rays, moisture, and temperature fluctuations** compared to natural rubber bands\[12\].

By implementing these storage strategies, you can significantly extend the life of your rubber band supplies even in the challenging environment of an unconditioned shed. The key is creating a controlled microenvironment within your storage containers that protects against the main degradation factors: light, oxygen, moisture, and temperature extremes.
