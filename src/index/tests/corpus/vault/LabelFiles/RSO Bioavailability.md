# RSO Bioavailability

> **Suppositories**\
> RSO can be delivered to the body via suppositories. Some dispensaries carry pre-made suppositories but it increases the cost of the treatment but a great guarantee of avoiding pyschoactivity if doses are placed not too high into the rectum (no more that 1.5” from the opening). This avoids contact with the Superior Vein and others leading to the liver.
>
> Suppository molds are available on Amazon as well as cocoa butter wafers. Coconut oil also works.

> Topically
>
> Rick Simpson initially used his oil topically, and this method is still popular today. For topical application, it's advisable to mix RSO with grain alcohol. This can be done by partially filling a 30ml tincture bottle with alcohol and adding a few drops of RSO, allowing the two to combine. Then, you can apply the infused alcohol to the desired area on your skin.

> - RSO is made using a solvent-based extraction process, typically involving ethanol or butane. The process is less refined, resulting in a darker, thicker oil that retains most of the plant’s compounds.
>
> - Distillates are made through a more complex process involving fractional distillation, where cannabinoids are separated and refined at precise temperatures to remove unwanted compounds. This results in a clearer and purer product, free of solvents and impurities.

## roa

> Rectal administration, often through suppositories, bypasses first-pass metabolism and can offer consistent absorption.

> *Rectal (\~13.5) –* This ROA involves utilizing the rectum as a means of bypassing the liver and hence unwanted conversion into other metabolites.

> *Buccal / Sublingual (10-25%) –* This ROA involves keeping the product in contact with the mucous membranes in between the cheek and the gum or the capillaries found under the tongue. This enables the active components to cross directly into the blood. This ROA also minimizes the conversion of THC into other metabolites.

- Transdermal (80 – 100%) – This ROA causes the actives to be delivered across the skin and directly into the blood. This enables the actives to bypass the liver and minimize conversion into the other metabolites produced by the oral route. Transdermal patches are a common product that utilizes this ROA.

The liver metabolism significantly affects the bioavailability of Rick Simpson Oil (RSO) when ingested orally. Here's how:

## First-Pass Metabolism

When RSO is ingested orally, it undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver, which substantially reduces its bioavailability:

- The bioavailability of ingested THC (a major component of RSO) is only 4% to 12%\[1\].

- This low bioavailability is due to extensive hepatic metabolism before the compounds reach the systemic circulation.

## Metabolic Pathways

RSO is primarily metabolized in the liver through several enzymatic processes:

- The cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system plays a crucial role in metabolizing cannabinoids\[1\]\[5\].

- Key enzymes involved include CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4\[5\].

- THC is metabolized into 11-OH-THC, which is also psychoactive, and then into 11-COOH-THC, which is not psychoactive\[1\].

## Factors Affecting Metabolism

Several factors can influence the liver's metabolism of RSO:

- Individual variations in CYP450 enzyme activity can affect metabolism rates\[5\].

- Liver disease or impairment may alter the metabolism of cannabinoids\[2\].

- Concurrent use of other medications that interact with CYP450 enzymes can affect RSO metabolism\[5\].

## Onset and Duration of Effects

The liver metabolism of RSO affects its onset and duration of effects:

- Oral ingestion leads to a slower onset of effects, typically 45 minutes to 2 hours\[4\].

- The effects tend to be more prolonged and intense compared to other administration methods due to the gradual release of cannabinoids from the liver\[4\].

## Lipophilicity and Distribution

The high lipophilicity of cannabinoids in RSO affects their distribution and metabolism:

- THC and other cannabinoids are rapidly taken up by fat tissue\[1\].

- This leads to a long half-life in the body, ranging from 1-3 days in occasional users to 5-13 days in chronic users\[1\].

Understanding these metabolic processes is crucial for determining appropriate dosing and anticipating the effects of RSO when ingested orally. The liver's extensive metabolism of RSO compounds significantly reduces their bioavailability, but also contributes to the prolonged duration of effects associated with oral consumption.

DMSO enhances penetration of other substances through:

	•	Aprotic interactions with intercellular lipids

	•	Reversible distortion of lipid head groups

	•	Formation of solvent microenvironments within tissue

	•	Solubilizing effects on less soluble agents

DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) can significantly affect the efficacy of pain relief creams, primarily by enhancing their absorption and penetration through the skin. Here's how DMSO impacts the effectiveness of topical pain medications:

## Enhanced Absorption

DMSO acts as a powerful penetration enhancer:

- It readily penetrates the skin and can carry other substances with it.

- This property allows DMSO to increase the absorption of topical medications applied simultaneously\[1\]\[2\].

## Mechanism of Action

DMSO enhances drug penetration through several mechanisms:

- Denaturation of proteins in the skin

- Interaction with lipid bilayers to loosen skin packing geometry

- Formation of solvent microenvironments within skin tissue\[5\]

## Impact on Specific Pain Medications

**Diclofenac:**

- A topical diclofenac solution containing 45.5% DMSO showed enhanced penetration of the active drug through the skin\[5\].

- However, one study found that DMSO did not improve diclofenac's efficacy compared to a formulation without DMSO\[9\].

**5-Fluorouracil (5-FU):**

- Topical application of DMSO with 5-FU demonstrated superior absorption compared to either substance alone in cream bases\[7\].

## Potential Benefits

- DMSO may improve the efficacy of certain pain relief creams by increasing their absorption and delivery to target tissues\[1\]\[2\].

- It could potentially allow for lower doses of active ingredients while maintaining effectiveness.

## Considerations and Risks

- DMSO's penetration-enhancing effect can also increase the absorption of unwanted substances or contaminants\[1\]\[2\].

- It may alter the pharmacokinetics of topical medications, potentially increasing both their effects and side effects\[2\].

- The combination of DMSO with other topical medications should be approached cautiously, as it could lead to dangerously increased medication absorption\[4\].

## Conclusion

While DMSO has the potential to enhance the efficacy of pain relief creams by improving their absorption, its effects can be unpredictable and may vary depending on the specific formulation and active ingredients. More research is needed to fully understand the interactions between DMSO and various topical pain medications. Patients should consult healthcare professionals before combining DMSO with other topical treatments to ensure safety and efficacy.

CBD cream

**Ingredients:** Water, DMSO, Mineral Oil, Isopropyl Myristate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerol Monostearate, Glycerin, Alkyl Polyglycol Ether, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, Hemp Extract (Delta 9 Tetrahydrocannabinol, Hexahydrocannabinol, Cannabidiol, Cannabigerol, Cannabidiolic Acid, Cannabigerolic Acid), Medium Chain Triglyceride Oil (Coconut), Polysorbate 60, Olive Oil, Sorbitan Monostearate, Ascorbic Acid (Preservative), Cannabigerol, α-Bisabolol, Terpineol, α-Pinene, Limonene, β-Caryophyllene, Linalool, Humulene.

The claim that cannabinoids are ineffective topically and do not have systemic effects is inaccurate for several reasons:

## Evidence of Systemic Absorption

Recent studies have demonstrated that cannabinoids can indeed enter systemic circulation through topical application:

- A pharmacokinetic study in humans showed that both CBD and THC successfully entered systemic circulation via transdermal administration\[2\].

- Steady-state plasma levels of CBD were achieved within 24 hours and maintained for at least 73 hours after topical application of an ethosomal CBD formulation\[3\].

## Factors Enhancing Absorption

Several factors can enhance the topical and transdermal absorption of cannabinoids:

- Chemical permeation enhancers like dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), polyethylene glycol-400 (PEG-400), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) can significantly improve the transdermal flux of cannabinoids\[4\].

- Advanced carrier systems such as ethosomal carriers and microemulsion formulations can increase skin flux of cannabinoids\[4\].

- Physical methods like microneedles and thermal ablation can enhance permeation by creating temporary microchannels in the skin\[4\].

## Bioavailability and Efficacy

Topical and transdermal application of cannabinoids has shown promising results:

- Transdermal delivery can provide higher bioavailability rates and prolonged steady plasma concentrations compared to other routes of administration\[4\].

- In a study of patients with rheumatic diseases, topical cannabis products were reported as effective for pain management\[5\].

## Physiological Basis

The skin contains an abundance of cannabinoid receptors, providing a physiological basis for the effectiveness of topical cannabinoids:

- Cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 are expressed in various skin cell types, including keratinocytes, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and immune cells\[4\].

- This receptor presence allows cannabinoids to potentially affect skin cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, and immune responses\[4\].

In conclusion, while the skin does present a barrier to absorption, advances in formulation and delivery technologies have made it possible for cannabinoids to be absorbed systemically through topical application. The presence of cannabinoid receptors in the skin further supports the potential for both localized and systemic effects from topically applied cannabinoids.

Transdermal administration of cannabinoids offers several advantages over oral consumption:

## Improved Bioavailability

- Transdermal delivery bypasses first-pass metabolism in the liver, which can degrade over 95% of orally administered cannabinoids\[1\].

- Bioavailability rates for transdermal cannabinoids are higher compared to oral administration\[1\].

## Steady Plasma Concentrations

- Transdermal application provides more constant cannabinoid plasma levels compared to oral consumption\[2\].

- Steady-state plasma concentrations can be achieved within 1.4 hours and maintained for at least 48 hours with transdermal patches\[1\].

## Reduced Psychoactive Effects

- Transdermal delivery may result in diminished psychotropic effects compared to oral consumption\[2\].

- The acidic degradation of CBD to THC, which can cause psychoactive effects, is avoided with transdermal application\[1\].

## Controlled Dosing

- Transdermal administration allows for more precise dosing and reduces the risk of overconsumption associated with oral intake\[2\].

- Drug therapy can be quickly terminated by removing the transdermal application from the skin's surface\[1\].

## Avoidance of Gastrointestinal Issues

- Transdermal delivery bypasses potential absorption issues caused by gastrointestinal pH\[1\].

- It can help avoid unwanted effects associated with oral consumption, such as nausea or stomach discomfort.

## Improved Patient Compliance

- Transdermal administration is often preferred by patients due to its convenience and ease of use\[1\].

- It can increase medical efficacy and reduce adverse effects, particularly in cancer treatment\[1\].

These advantages make transdermal cannabinoid delivery a promising option for both medical and recreational use, potentially offering improved therapeutic outcomes and user experience compared to oral consumption.

Transdermal drug delivery effectively avoids first-pass metabolism through the following mechanisms:

1. Direct entry into systemic circulation: Drugs delivered transdermally enter the bloodstream directly through capillaries in the dermis, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract and liver\[1\]\[4\].

2. Absorption through skin layers: The medication diffuses through the skin's layers (epidermis and dermis) before reaching the bloodstream, avoiding the digestive system entirely\[2\]\[3\].

3. Sustained release: Transdermal patches provide controlled and sustained drug release over time, maintaining steady plasma concentrations without the peaks and troughs associated with oral administration\[2\]\[4\].

4. Improved bioavailability: By avoiding hepatic first-pass metabolism, a lower amount of drug can be administered to achieve therapeutic effects, potentially reducing side effects and improving safety\[4\]\[5\].

5. Elimination of gastrointestinal degradation: Transdermal delivery bypasses the destructive acidic environment of the stomach, which can degrade certain drugs when taken orally\[3\].

This avoidance of first-pass metabolism allows for more efficient drug delivery, particularly for medications that are poorly bioavailable when taken orally or those that require frequent dosing to maintain therapeutic levels\[1\]\[5\].

## 

To effectively administer a suppository and avoid first-pass metabolism, it is essential to understand both the technique for insertion and the physiological implications of the first-pass effect.

## What is First-Pass Metabolism?

First-pass metabolism refers to the process by which a drug's concentration is significantly reduced before it reaches systemic circulation. This occurs primarily in the liver after a drug is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. When medications are taken orally, they pass through the digestive system, where they are metabolized by enzymes in the gut and liver, potentially reducing their effectiveness.

## How to Administer a Suppository

To maximize absorption and minimize first-pass metabolism when using a suppository, follow these steps:

1. **Preparation**:

   - Ensure the rectum is emptied prior to insertion to enhance absorption and reduce interference from stool.

   - Use a water-soluble lubricant on the suppository if needed (avoid petroleum jelly as it can inhibit absorption).

2. **Insertion Technique**:

   - Position yourself comfortably (lying on your side with knees bent or standing with one foot elevated).

   - Insert the suppository about a finger’s length into the rectum, narrow end first. This position helps ensure that the suppository is placed against the rectal wall where absorption is optimal.

   - Retain the suppository for at least 30-60 minutes to allow for proper absorption.

3. **Post-Administration**:

   - Avoid bowel movements for at least an hour after insertion to ensure that the medication has time to dissolve and be absorbed.

   - If necessary, you can use warm water (up to 10 ml) rectally to assist in dissolving the suppository.

## Avoiding First-Pass Metabolism

By administering medication via the rectal route, particularly in the lower part of the rectum, you can bypass significant first-pass metabolism:

- The lower rectum is drained by the middle and inferior rectal veins, which lead directly to systemic circulation (the inferior vena cava), thus avoiding the liver initially.

- In contrast, drugs administered in the upper rectum are drained by the superior rectal vein, which empties into the portal system and subjects them to first-pass metabolism.

This means that medications delivered via suppositories can achieve higher bioavailability compared to oral administration, making them effective alternatives for patients who cannot take medications orally or require rapid onset of action without extensive metabolic degradation. 

In summary, proper administration of a suppository not only enhances its effectiveness but also allows for significant avoidance of first-pass metabolism, ensuring that more of the active drug enters systemic circulation.

To avoid first-pass metabolism when administering a rectal suppository, it's important to target the lower part of the rectum. Here are the key points to consider:

1. Optimal insertion depth: Insert the suppository about 1 inch (2.5 cm) into the rectum for adults\[2\]\[8\]. This depth is generally sufficient to reach the lower rectum without going too far.

2. Anatomical considerations: The lower part of the rectum is drained by the middle and inferior rectal veins, which return blood directly to the inferior vena cava, bypassing the liver\[1\]\[3\]. This allows for partial avoidance of first-pass metabolism.

3. Avoiding the upper rectum: Inserting the suppository too far (beyond 3 inches or 7.5 cm) may reach the upper rectum, which is drained by the superior rectal vein. This vein empties into the portal system, subjecting the drug to first-pass metabolism\[1\]\[3\].

4. Variability in absorption: It's important to note that the bioavailability of drugs given rectally can be highly variable due to extensive anastomoses between the rectal veins\[1\].

5. Proper technique: To ensure correct placement, insert the suppository about a finger's length into the rectum and place it against the rectal wall\[1\]\[3\].

By following these guidelines, you can maximize the chances of avoiding first-pass metabolism while ensuring proper drug absorption. However, it's crucial to remember that individual anatomy may vary, and consulting with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance is always recommended.

When cannabinoids and cannabis avoid first-pass metabolism versus when they are metabolized by the liver, patients can experience significant differences in effects, onset time, duration, and overall therapeutic outcomes. Here are the key distinctions:

## Avoiding First-Pass Metabolism

**Rapid Onset**

- Inhalation methods like smoking or vaping provide almost immediate effects, with peak plasma concentrations reached within minutes\[1\]\[5\].

- Transdermal administration can achieve steady-state plasma concentrations within 1.4 hours\[6\].

**Higher Bioavailability**

- Inhaled cannabinoids have a bioavailability of approximately 30%\[5\].

- Transdermal delivery can potentially offer bioavailability rates of 80-100%\[9\].

**Consistent Plasma Levels**

- Transdermal application can maintain steady cannabinoid plasma levels for up to 48-72 hours\[6\]\[9\].

**Reduced Psychoactive Effects**

- Methods that bypass first-pass metabolism may result in diminished psychotropic effects, especially with transdermal delivery\[6\]\[9\].

## Undergoing First-Pass Metabolism

**Delayed Onset**

- Oral administration leads to slower absorption, with peak plasma concentrations reached after 1-5 hours\[5\]\[8\].

**Lower Bioavailability**

- Oral THC has a bioavailability of only 4-12%, while oral CBD ranges from 6-19%\[3\]\[5\]\[8\].

**Variable Effects**

- Oral administration can result in more unpredictable effects due to individual variations in metabolism and absorption\[1\].

**Increased Psychoactive Potential**

- Oral THC undergoes conversion to 11-OH-THC, a potent psychoactive metabolite, which may lead to stronger psychoactive effects\[4\]\[8\].

**Longer Duration**

- Effects from oral administration typically last longer due to slower metabolism and release of cannabinoids stored in fatty tissues\[5\].

These differences in patient experiences highlight the importance of considering administration routes when using cannabinoids for therapeutic purposes. Methods that avoid first-pass metabolism may offer advantages in terms of rapid onset, consistent plasma levels, and potentially reduced psychoactive effects. However, oral administration, despite lower bioavailability, may be preferred for longer-lasting effects or when a delayed onset is desired.

The liver's metabolism significantly affects the psychoactive properties of THC through several key mechanisms:

## Conversion to 11-OH-THC

When THC is metabolized by the liver, it undergoes a transformation that enhances its psychoactive effects:

- The liver enzymes, primarily CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, convert THC into 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC)\[1\]\[3\].

- 11-OH-THC is more potent than THC and can cross the blood-brain barrier more easily\[1\]\[4\].

- This metabolite retains high CB1 receptor affinity and may be even slightly more psychoactive than THC itself\[4\].

## Bioavailability and Onset of Effects

The liver's first-pass metabolism affects how quickly and intensely THC's effects are felt:

- Oral consumption of THC results in slower onset but potentially more intense and longer-lasting effects due to the production of 11-OH-THC\[1\]\[2\].

- The bioavailability of orally administered THC is only about 5-20% due to first-pass metabolism\[2\].

- Peak concentrations of THC and 11-OH-THC occur 0.5 to 4 hours after oral administration, with effects potentially lasting 4 to 8 hours or more\[1\]\[2\].

## Individual Variations

The liver's metabolism of THC can vary significantly between individuals:

- Genetic variations in CYP450 enzymes can affect how quickly or slowly THC is metabolized\[6\].

- Poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 may experience more intense or prolonged effects due to slower THC breakdown\[6\].

## Comparison to Other Routes of Administration

The liver's role in THC metabolism creates distinct differences between oral consumption and other methods:

- Inhalation methods like smoking or vaping bypass first-pass metabolism, resulting in quicker onset but potentially less intense effects\[8\].

- Transdermal or sublingual administration may also avoid significant first-pass metabolism, leading to different psychoactive profiles\[8\].

Understanding these metabolic processes is crucial for anticipating the effects of THC, especially when consumed orally. The liver's conversion of THC to 11-OH-THC significantly contributes to the unique, often more potent and longer-lasting psychoactive experience associated with edible cannabis products.

The liver's metabolism affects the psychoactive properties of cannabinoids other than THC in several ways:

## CBD (Cannabidiol)

- Unlike THC, CBD is non-psychoactive and does not produce intoxicating effects\[3\].

- CBD is metabolized in the liver by CYP450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C19 and CYP3A4\[8\].

- When CBD and THC are administered together, CBD can act as an antagonist at cannabinoid receptors, potentially blocking some of THC's psychoactive effects\[9\].

## CBN (Cannabinol)

- CBN is only weakly psychoactive compared to THC\[9\].

- It is primarily formed from the degradation of THC within the cannabis plant itself, rather than through liver metabolism\[9\].

## THCV (Tetrahydrocannabivarin)

- THCV has shown potential antisteatogenic effects in the liver, reducing liver triglycerides and fasting insulin levels in preclinical studies\[3\].

- While not directly related to psychoactivity, these metabolic effects in the liver could indirectly influence how THCV interacts with the body's endocannabinoid system.

## General Cannabinoid Metabolism

- The liver's cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C and CYP3A, play a crucial role in metabolizing various cannabinoids\[8\].

- This hepatic metabolism can affect the bioavailability and duration of action of different cannabinoids, potentially influencing their psychoactive properties.

- The expressions of cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 are up-regulated in progressive liver disease, which may alter how the body responds to various cannabinoids in patients with liver conditions\[2\].

In conclusion, while THC undergoes significant psychoactive potentiation through liver metabolism, other cannabinoids like CBD and CBN have different metabolic pathways that do not enhance their psychoactivity. The liver's role in cannabinoid metabolism is crucial in determining the overall effects of these compounds, including their potential therapeutic benefits and interactions with the endocannabinoid system.

The liver plays a crucial role in metabolizing various cannabinoids, including those other than THC. Here's an overview of how the liver processes different cannabinoids:

## CBD (Cannabidiol) Metabolism

CBD is primarily metabolized in the liver through the following processes:

- Hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C19 and CYP3A4\[4\]\[6\].

- Formation of 7-hydroxy-CBD (7-OH-CBD) and 7-carboxy-CBD (CBD-COOH)\[3\].

- Glucuronidation to form 7-carboxy-CBD-glucuronide\[3\].

CBD undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, with unchanged CBD and glucuronidated CBD being the main excretion products in urine\[3\].

## CBN (Cannabinol) Metabolism

CBN, a non-enzymatic oxidation byproduct of THC, is metabolized in the liver similarly to other cannabinoids:

- Processed by the cytochrome P450 system, particularly CYP2C and CYP3A enzymes\[6\].

- Undergoes phase II metabolism through glucuronidation by UGT enzymes\[6\].

## General Cannabinoid Metabolism

Most cannabinoids follow a similar metabolic pathway in the liver:

- Phase I metabolism: Primarily conducted by the cytochrome P450 system, involving enzymes such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4\[7\].

- Phase II metabolism: Glucuronidation of phase I metabolites, facilitated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, particularly UGT1A9 and UGT2B7\[4\]\[7\].

## Impact on Liver Function

The metabolism of cannabinoids can affect liver function in several ways:

- Cannabinoids may inhibit or induce various CYP450 enzymes, potentially leading to drug-drug interactions\[4\].

- In patients with advanced liver disease, the expression of cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) is upregulated, which may alter the liver's response to cannabinoids\[7\].

- Some studies suggest that CBD may have hepatoprotective effects, potentially reducing liver inflammation and oxidative stress\[2\].

It's important to note that while cannabinoids are extensively metabolized by the liver, the risk of liver damage from CBD at doses commonly found in dietary supplements and food products is considered low\[9\]. However, more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of cannabinoid metabolism on liver function.

## Carrier oils

++[MCT oil](https://ingredi.com/mct-oil-radia-7102-k-195-kg-drum)++ is a popular choice for use with CBD and is generally regarded as one of the best carrier oil options. Both coconut oil and palm oil contain high levels of MCT, and unlike the other oils with names indicative of their source, MCT gets its name from the structure of its molecules: Medium Chain Triglycerides. In the case of MCT, its size and structure matters.

Triglyceride is just another name for fat and oil molecules. The size is determined by how many carbon atoms are contained in its structure. While most fats and oils contain Long Chain Triglycerides (LCT) with 14 or more carbon atoms, MCTs contain significantly less carbon (between 16 and 12). This size difference is what helps make MCT an effective carrier oil for CBD, as well as providing other potential health benefits.

Due to its smaller molecular structure, MCT is more digested and absorbed more easily by the human body. When used as a carrier for CBD, MCT provides greater bioavailability. When cannabinoids breakdown, they are stored in fat, which means they are best administered with fat to increase absorption.

Medium Chain Triglycerides are better than oil with LCTs because they blend with water more efficiently (remember, the human body is made up of large amounts of water). The digestive tract can send MCTs to the bloodstream without the aid of chylomicrons; when substances like CBD can go to your bloodstream quickly without needing to be digested first, you will feel the effects far sooner.

> Hey guys! I moved from Colorado to Western Massachusetts last year (Family). I work at a hydro shop and it’s been really awesome to watch MA progress with its Cannabis culture. So I’ve been making Cannabis Topical Balm and I’ve been including DMSO as an ingredient and WOW does it work! DMSO is a polar and non-polar solvent that has transdermal properties, it pulls the balm right into the affected (effected?) area. I think I cured arthritis, and my Mom has been putting it on her cancer radiation wound and her latest biopsy was clean and the wound (which is over a year old) is getting smaller. Everyone I trade or give it to raves about it.
>
> **Here is my recipe:**\
> 2 oz decarbed cannabis flower (higher cbd the better)\
> 2 oz dried arnica flower (anti inflammatory herb)\
> 5 cups organic coconut oil\
> Steep for 5 hours or magic butter machine it\
> While the oil is still warm\
> Blend in\
> 2 oz local beeswax\
> 2 oz DMSO\
> It is important to give a disclaimer on the DMSO – it opens up your skin to allow everything that follows it to penetrate. This is a bad thing for things like makeup, Aluminum deodorants, motor oil, etc. This means to wash it off your hands really well after applying it so you don’t draw the next thing you touch into your bloodstream. The bottle of DMSO actually says on the label that it is illegal to market DMSO for it health benefits in any way – which I found humorous that the cannabis is legal in my topical but the DMSO makes it illegal. Anyway – if my math is correct the Balm is less than 5%DMSO so it is very mild in its transdermalness. Hit me back if you have questions or want a sample, I’d love to post a recipe to your page. Spread the word because this topical works 10x better than the ones they sell over the counter I tried in Colorado and those work great. I’m talking healing pain relief for any inflammation. Oh yeah it cured our dachshund of her herniated disc which paralyzed her from the waste and the vets said only $6000 surgery would make her walk again.
