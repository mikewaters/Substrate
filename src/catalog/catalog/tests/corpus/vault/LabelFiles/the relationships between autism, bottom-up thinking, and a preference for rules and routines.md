# the relationships between autism, bottom-up thinking, and a preference for rules and routines

There is indeed research that explores the relationships between autism, bottom-up thinking, and a preference for rules and routines. Here's a brief overview of some relevant findings:

1. Bottom-up thinking: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit a tendency towards bottom-up processing, focusing on individual details rather than the broader context or meaning (Happé & Frith, 2006). This cognitive style is sometimes referred to as "weak central coherence" (Frith, 1989). Bottom-up thinking can lead to strengths in areas such as attention to detail and pattern recognition.

2. Rule-following and routines: Many individuals with ASD have a strong preference for routines, predictability, and rule-governed behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This may be related to difficulties with flexibility, adapting to change, and executive functioning (Hill, 2004). Adherence to routines and rules can provide a sense of structure and reduce anxiety in unpredictable situations.

3. Relationship between bottom-up thinking and rule-following: Some researchers propose that the preference for rules and routines in ASD may be a consequence of bottom-up processing (Pellicano & Burr, 2012). By focusing on specific details and rules, individuals with ASD may find it easier to navigate and make sense of their environment. Routines and rule-following can provide a framework for organizing and interpreting information in a bottom-up manner.

4. Implications for intervention: Understanding the relationships between bottom-up thinking, rule-following, and routines can inform the development of targeted interventions for individuals with ASD. For example, using visual schedules, providing explicit instructions, and breaking tasks down into smaller steps can support bottom-up processing and reduce anxiety related to uncertainty (Mesibov et al., 2004).

It's important to note that autism is a spectrum disorder, and the extent to which these characteristics manifest can vary greatly among individuals. Additionally, these cognitive styles should not be seen as deficits but rather as differences in information processing that can confer both strengths and challenges.

The 2012 paper by Elizabeth Pellicano and David Burr, titled *"When the world becomes 'too real': a Bayesian explanation of autistic perception,"* explores the application of Bayesian models to understand perceptual differences in autism\[1\]\[2\]. The authors propose that individuals with autism may experience the world differently due to what they term "hypo-priors." These are attenuated Bayesian priors, which suggest that the influence of prior knowledge on perception is weaker in autistic individuals compared to neurotypical individuals\[2\]\[3\].

This hypothesis implies that autistic individuals might perceive the world more accurately, as their perception is less influenced by previous experiences and expectations. The paper suggests that these hypo-priors could explain various sensory and non-social atypicalities observed in autism, as well as the phenomenological differences in perception\[2\]\[5\].

The concept of hypo-priors offers a novel perspective on the sensory experiences of autistic individuals, indicating that their perception might be less biased by prior experiences, leading to a more literal interpretation of sensory input\[4\]. This framework provides insight into the broad range of perceptual and cognitive characteristics associated with autism\[5\].
