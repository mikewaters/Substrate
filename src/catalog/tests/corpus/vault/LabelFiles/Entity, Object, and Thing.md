# *Entity*, *Object*, and *Thing*

gpt5

*Entity*, *Object*, and *Thing*) are closely related but have distinct philosophical nuances, particularly in **ontology** (the study of being).

---

### **1\. Entity**

- **General Meaning:** “Entity” is the broadest and most neutral term. It refers to *anything that exists* — or can be said to exist — without specifying its mode of being.

- **Ontological Role:** In classical ontology, *entity* denotes a *unit of being*, encompassing all categories — physical, abstract, potential, fictional, etc.

- **Scope:** Includes objects, events, processes, ideas, numbers, properties, and even absences (depending on the ontology).

- **Example:** The number 7, a symphony, a person, a shadow, or a company are all *entities*.

> **Key idea:** “Entity” = anything that *has being* or *can be referred to as existing* in some sense.

### **2\. Object**

- **General Meaning:** “Object” narrows the focus to *entities that can be individuated* and *stand in relations*, often as subjects or targets of perception, thought, or reference.

- **Ontological Role:** In many traditions (Aristotelian, phenomenological, analytic), *object* refers to something *that can be experienced, conceptualized, or predicated*. It’s the **ontological correlate of intentionality** — something that can be an “object of thought.”

- **Scope:** Usually concrete or at least *individuated*; not all entities are objects (e.g., universals or events might not be).

- **Example:** A chair, a tree, or a particular electron are *objects*; “justice” is an *entity* but not necessarily an *object* in this sense.

> **Key idea:** “Object” = an *entity that can be individuated or referred to as a unit in thought or experience*.

### **3\. Thing**

- **General Meaning:** “Thing” (from Old English *þing*, “assembly, matter under discussion”) usually denotes *material or concrete objects*, though it can be used more loosely.

- **Ontological Role:** In metaphysics, *thing* often connotes *a self-subsisting individual* — something that exists “in itself.” Heidegger famously distinguishes between “things” and “objects”: things *gather* relations (they are nexuses of meaning), while objects are what result when we represent things as present-at-hand.

- **Scope:** Typically *spatiotemporal* and *substantial*, though not always.

- **Example:** A rock, a car, or a cup — paradigmatic *things*. An event (like a concert) is an *entity*, but not a *thing*.

> **Key idea:** “Thing” = a *self-subsistent, concrete, individual being*.

### **Philosophical Lineages**

- **Aristotle:** *Substance (ousia)* corresponds roughly to “thing,” while *being* encompasses all entities.

- **Kant:** “Object” is that which corresponds to our representations; “thing-in-itself” (*Ding an sich*) transcends them.

- **Heidegger:** Critiques the reduction of *things* to *objects*—argues that things “gather” worlds rather than just stand before us.

- **Contemporary Ontology (e.g., Quine, BFO):** Uses “entity” as the most general ontological term; “object” for particulars; “thing” rarely appears except informally.
