# Pocketbase

> [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) is an open source Go backend, consisting of:
>
> - embedded database (*SQLite*) with **realtime subscriptions**
>
> - built-in **files and users management**
>
> - convenient **Admin dashboard UI**
>
> - and simple **REST-ish API**
>
> **For documentation and examples, please visit <https://pocketbase.io/docs>.**

Appears to be part of the Google ecosystem, in that its primary SDKs are for Javascript and [Dart.md](./Dart.md)

It is IMO analogous to Drupal, but it might be useful for an admin workload, if I can replicate data to and from its embedded SQLite database.
