# The Role of the Stratum Corneum in Topical Drug Absorption

Barrier Function — The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the skin and acts as a primary barrier to the ingress and egress of substances.

Drug Penetration — It limits the penetration of most drugs, making it challenging for topical carriers to reach the bloodstream.

Nanocarriers — Technologies like nanocarriers can enhance drug penetration through the stratum corneum, allowing both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs to be delivered effectively.

Low Permeability — The stratum corneum's low permeability restricts the number of drugs that can be absorbed transdermally.

Transdermal Systems — Transdermal delivery systems, such as patches and microneedles, are designed to bypass or penetrate the stratum corneum to deliver drugs systemically.

Stratum Corneum Structure

Composition — The stratum corneum is composed of dead keratinized cells embedded in a lipid matrix.

Layers — It consists of 15-20 layers of flattened cells. Barrier — Acts as a barrier to protect underlying tissues from

pathogens, chemicals, and water loss.

Hydration — Maintains skin hydration by preventing excessive water loss.

Lipid-Rich — The lipid content includes ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids, which contribute to its barrier function.

          Enhancing Drug Penetration

 Nanocarriers — Use of nanoparticles, ethosomes, dendrimers, and liposomes to enhance drug delivery.

Microneedles — Create micropores in the skin to bypass the stratum corneum.

Iontophoresis — Uses electrical currents to drive drugs through the skin.

Ultrasound — Employs sound waves to increase skin permeability. Laser — Utilizes laser technology to disrupt the stratum corneum and

enhance drug absorption.

The use of nanocarriers for increasing the range of available drugs for the transdermal delivery has emerged as a valuable and exciting alternative.

Transdermal Delivery Systems

Patches — Provide controlled and sustained drug release over time.

Gels — Allow for localized drug delivery with minimal systemic effects.

Ointments — Used for both local and systemic drug delivery.

Patches — Examples include nicotine, fentanyl, and hormone patches.

Adhesives — Ensure the patch remains in contact with the skin for effective drug delivery.
