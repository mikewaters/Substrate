### **Video Playlist Organizer**

Is a:: Application

One of:: [LifeOS Utilities.md](./LifeOS%20Utilities.md)

- youtube playlists are not organized 

- gas digital downloader

I would like my video playlists to be smarter and better organized

Read in videos in a playlist-bucket, and classify them based on some custom logic. Move them to new playlists based on classification.

Can build upon this later for other youtube stuff.

I also want to know what i’ve already watched wtf youtube

### YT playlist userscript

> Drag and drop interface to organize playlists on YouTube

WEIRD:

> Why Userscript instead of YouTube API
>
> As of 2016, the Watch Later list has been depricated from YouTube's API. As a result, the only way to programatically make changes to the Watch Later list is by directly emulating user actions on the website.
