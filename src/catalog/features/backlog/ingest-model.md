# Ingest notes

## Folder path
- Folder path should be a first class ONTOLOGY property, as its relevant to Obsidian, Heptabase (whiteboards), Bookmarks.  Needs to support multiple (Heptabase)
- Add folder path to Document or Resource, support multiple, for obsidian take from vault path, for URLs have user input or get from raindrop

What do I want to vary?
