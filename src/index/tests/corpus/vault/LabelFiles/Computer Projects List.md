# Computer Projects List

Goal: I want to spend more time in the terminal, as my skills are wasting away. I used to kinda-sorta-enjoy it.

## Getting familiar with the $TERM

[Using WezTerm](https://app.heptabase.com/2f7caf87-d999-4778-8e30-61689601271e/card/242b8bcf-5d14-42a5-a940-60768b31b675) - I need to set up the new terminal app for configurations like word movement

Getting familiar with [Vim!Nvim Learning.md](./Vim!Nvim%20Learning.md)

Evaluating [Zed Editor.md](./Zed%20Editor.md)

## Cleaning up stuff

[My Directory Structures.md](./My%20Directory%20Structures.md) and files on Beaker

## Creating documentation

[Mike’s Computer Runbook.md](./Mike’s%20Computer%20Runbook.md)

## Terminal-based apps to replace $X

- a Postman replacement using TUI <https://github.com/darrenburns/posting>

   - note: I can use ‘uv{x}’ to run this, but I’d probably use brew unless its better

## Notes

- The successor to Pocoo’s ‘Rye’ - ‘uv’ - has the ability to run python based commands (“tools”) in an isolated virtualenv, silently. Cool. <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/>
