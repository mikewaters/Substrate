# Current State Reference

**day-over-day memory aid**

[Continuity.txt.md](./Continuity.txt.md) [Continuity.txt .md](./Continuity.txt%20.md)

Is a::Solution Capability

This is more the abstract idea of a type of short term memory aid (append log)

aka Current State Reference

Implementation ideas:

- text files, or abstractions of a text file

- using structured text for such, like markdown or [MichaelDown.md](./MichaelDown.md)

### **Memory helper: continuity.txt**

cf; productivity.txt, et al

I want to be able to write a journal and personal logs in a single stream of consciousness document, and have that be analyzed for every change to:

- add metadata to entries, like date or location

- normalize and/or classify entries, like identifying a meal record from free form text

- analyze entries, like a summary or matching to some project

- match entries with other similar entries, to gather like metrics

   - ex: i’ve worried about the same issue or thought about the same things N times

- Data object seems to be Entry

- Solution 3: [Current State Reference.md](./Current%20State%20Reference.md)
