# PKM++ Tools

Status:: Experiment-Complete

What: I am evaluating whether or not Roam Research is going to work for me. There are a few new “visual” PKMs that look like they really have promise in getting my life to start fitting into my brain.

## Capacities

I should re-evaluate this tool in the future, but at this point I’ve cancelled my subscription.

I am considering using the Capacities app as well, it looks like it might be good for “the finished product”, while Heptabase is better for the cooking.

To get the mobile app, you have to pay: <https://capacities.io/believer>

### The Good

- Visualization is amazing and the card editor is perfect

### The Bad

- I need a way to get highlights here more easily, like immediately 

- There is no indenting like roam, I like having related blocks



Resources:

- Safari tab group

- Whiteboard

- Bookmarks folder

- Punch list (aka a task-to-do-later-maybe list)
