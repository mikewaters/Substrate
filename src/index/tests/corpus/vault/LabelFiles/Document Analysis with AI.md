# Document Analysis with AI



> Document understanding, document analysis, or document intelligence are commonly used terms for using an LLM to extract information and answer questions about files. The specific task of identifying document types and extracting key details is often called document classification and information extraction.
>
> More technically, when an LLM looks at a document and answers questions about it, this is an example of "zero-shot document understanding" or "zero-shot information extraction" since the model can analyze documents without being specifically trained on them.
>
> The process is sometimes also referred to as "document QA" (question-answering) or "document querying" when you're specifically asking questions about the document's contents.
