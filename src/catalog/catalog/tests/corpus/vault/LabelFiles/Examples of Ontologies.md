# Examples of Ontologies

### Finding Good Ontologies and Taxonomies

- Github topic “[ontologies](https://github.com/topics/ontologies)”

### Semantic Web Ontologies

Ontotext RAG says they’d help extract: <https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-graph-rag/>

There are many ontologies, in addition to [schema.org](schema.org): <https://dbpedia.org/ontology/Poem>

### Useful Top-Level Ontologies

A list of some top-level ontologies can be found in [Top-Level Ontologies Survey.pdf](../Card%20Library/Top-Level%20Ontologies%20Survey.pdf) (Appendix D).

#### Gist

Simplest. <https://github.com/semanticarts/gist>

#### Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)

> The Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is a small, upper-level ontology that is designed for use in supporting information retrieval, analysis and integration in scientific and other domains

#### Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry

Built on top of [BFO](https://app.heptabase.com/2f7caf87-d999-4778-8e30-61689601271e/card/8ffea3f3-be41-4556-924d-68af7f8c52ec#a416491b-0cab-4bc5-8036-97cd86eeb256) and its own [Relation Ontology](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/ro.html)

[OBO Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/) - Community development of interoperable ontologies for the biological sciences

^^ this link has an OWL browser and a bunch of domains

#### Gene Ontology (GO)

Has OWL files to review.

#### Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology (BCIO)

[HumanBehaviourChangeProject - A repository for the BCIO ontology](https://github.com/HumanBehaviourChangeProject/ontologies)

Has OWL files to review.

#### [RDoc and HiTOP](https://app.heptabase.com/2f7caf87-d999-4778-8e30-61689601271e/card/8b88a959-1008-4887-8bcb-83a07caf3b8c)

RDoC defines a number of domains within psychiatry, each with domain-specific “Constructs”, as well as “Elements” - described by an aggregate of specific dimensions - that are considered relevant to that construct.

The dimensions for an element include: Genes (ex BDNF), Molecules (ex. Cortisol), Cells (ex. Pituitary), Circuits (ex. Amygdala), and Behavior (ex. Avoidance).

| Genes | Molecules | Cells | Circuits | Behavior | 
|---|---|---|---|---|

In the RDoC domain “Negative Valance Systems”, which contains bad shit, the construct “Acute Threat/Fear” might be described using the following dimensions:

| ++Genes++ | ++Molecules++ | ++Cells++ | ++Circuits++ | ++Behavior++ | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BDNF | Dopamine | Glial | Central Nucleus | Response inhibition |
