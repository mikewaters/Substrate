# the illusion of explanatory depth

cognitive bias 

where people believe they understand complex systems or concepts more deeply than they actually do.

Think about a bicycle. Most people would say they understand how a bicycle works. But when asked to explain in detail how the gears shift, how turning the handlebars translates to directional change, or how the brakes engage, many discover gaps in their knowledge they didn't realize existed.

This phenomenon was first formally studied by researchers Leonid Rozenblit and Frank Keil in 2002. They found that people consistently overestimate their understanding of how things work - from everyday objects like toilets and zippers to natural phenomena like tides and rainbows.

Some key aspects of this illusion:

1. The gap between perceived and actual understanding tends to be largest for systems that appear simple on the surface but have hidden complexity

2. Simply asking people to generate detailed explanations often reveals to them the limits of their understanding (known as the "explain effect")

3. The illusion is particularly strong for mechanical and causal systems, where we can observe the end result but not necessarily all the intermediate steps

4. This overconfidence diminishes when people are asked to actually explain something step-by-step or draw detailed diagrams

The implications of this bias are significant for learning, teaching, and communication. When experts explain things to novices, they often unconsciously skip steps that seem obvious to them but are actually crucial for true understanding.

Would you like to test this phenomenon? Pick any everyday object or system you think you understand well, and I can help guide you through a detailed explanation that might reveal some surprising gaps in understanding.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
