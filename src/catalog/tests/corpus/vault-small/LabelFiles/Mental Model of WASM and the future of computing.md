# Mental Model of WASM and the future of computing

## Thoughts

**Alternative Runtimes**

I worry that if WASM takes off in the way I think it will, the device-side runtime will become very important, and this is currently dominated by Chrome. Maybe this is why alt browsers are coming out?

We need wasm runtimes that can rival the browser

## Concepts

### WebGPU

> WebGPU exposes an API for performing operations, such as rendering and computation

> wgpu is a cross-platform, safe, pure-rust dgraphics API. It runs natively on Vulkan, Metal, D3D12, and OpenGL; and on top of WebGL2 and WebGPU on wasm.
