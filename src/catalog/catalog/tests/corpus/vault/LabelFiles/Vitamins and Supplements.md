## Notes

> Some people find L-theanine supplement helpful for reducing anxiety

> started taking bacopa monnieri and it improved my memory and mental endurance, anxiety and depression. I gave it to my wife and had the totally opposite effect

> Bacopa Monnieri aka Brahmi has been very effective to eliminate mental turbulence for me. 

> Cod is super high in Vitamin D, and considered by many historians the secret food that contributed to Vikings success.

> Fish oil is a source of omega-3 fatty acids. It reduces triglycerides, but does not seem to affect the rate of cardiovascular events. It seems to notably reduce the symptoms of depression and improve some painful, inflammatory conditions. <https://examine.com/supplements/fish-oil/>
