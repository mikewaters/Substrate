# Sample taxonomy and topic dataset for integration tests
# Format:
# taxonomies:
#   - id: <uuid or string>
#     title: <string>
#     description: <string>
#     default_language: en
#     topics:
#       - id: <uuid>
#         title: <string>
#         description: <string>
#         status: active
#         aliases: [list]
#         parents: [<topic-id>, ...]   # optional for non-root topics
#
# Notes:
# - Hierarchies are expressed by referencing parent topic IDs in each topic's parents list.
# - Root topics omit the parents field.
# - For polyhierarchy demonstration, some topics have two parents.
# - IDs are stable strings (not real UUIDs) for test determinism.
