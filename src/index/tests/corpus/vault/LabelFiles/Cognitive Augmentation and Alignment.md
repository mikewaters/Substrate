# Cognitive Augmentation and Alignment

If I don’t have to remember it, I shouldn’t try to.

Delegate memory demands (memory aug)

Hacking tools and systems to make them work better with my dumb brain.

Where I do not have a good mapping between my mental model of a domain and the working model of some task, process, or tool needed within that domain, [Cognitive Impedance Mismatch Friction.md](./Cognitive%20Impedance%20Mismatch%20Friction.md) can leave me unable to work within that domain effectively.

These use cases should “glue together” tools and processes, as well as provide adaptations to the tools or processes to better fit my mental model or to be easier for my specific brain to utilize.
