# Magnesium deficiency as a factor in the development of cardiovascular disease

Magnesium deficiency has been identified as a significant factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, particularly in relation to coronary plaque formation and atherosclerosis. Research has shown that low magnesium levels are associated with an increased risk of various cardiovascular issues, including coronary artery calcification and atherosclerosis\[1\]\[6\].

## Magnesium and Atherosclerosis

Low magnesium levels have been linked to several processes that contribute to atherosclerosis:

1. **Endothelial dysfunction**: Magnesium deficiency can lead to endothelial dysfunction, which is the initiating event in plaque formation\[3\].

2. **Inflammation**: Studies have shown that low magnesium intake is associated with higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of chronic inflammation that contributes to atherosclerosis\[2\].

3. **Lipid profile**: Experimentally induced low plasma levels of magnesium can accelerate atherogenesis by increasing LDL concentrations and their oxidative modifications\[3\].

4. **Vascular calcification**: Magnesium plays a role in preventing vascular calcification, which is a key component of atherosclerotic plaques\[1\]\[4\].

## Coronary Artery Calcification

Research has demonstrated a strong inverse association between magnesium intake and coronary artery calcification (CAC):

- In the Framingham Heart Study, a 50-mg/day increment in total magnesium intake was associated with 22% lower CAC\[6\].

- Individuals with the highest magnesium intake had 58% lower odds of having any CAC compared to those with the lowest intake\[6\].

## Mechanisms of Action

Magnesium's protective effects against coronary plaque formation and calcification may be attributed to several mechanisms:

1. **Calcium antagonism**: Magnesium acts as a calcium antagonist, potentially inhibiting the deposition of calcium in arterial walls\[4\]\[6\].

2. **Inhibition of hydroxyapatite formation**: Magnesium directly inhibits hydroxyapatite and crystal precipitation, which are components of vascular calcification\[6\].

3. **Regulation of cellular processes**: Magnesium is essential for the proper functioning of the Na+–K+ pump and plays a role in modulating potassium-proton exchange, which affects cellular metabolism and vascular health\[4\].

4. **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Magnesium deficiency has been shown to increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neuropeptides, contributing to vascular inflammation\[1\].

## Clinical Implications

The relationship between magnesium deficiency and coronary plaque formation has important clinical implications:

- Magnesium supplementation has been shown to improve endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease\[3\].

- Oral magnesium therapy could be a useful adjuvant in preventing atherosclerosis and treating patients with clinical manifestations of the disease\[3\].

- Increasing magnesium intake through diet or supplementation may be a cost-effective strategy to reduce the risk of coronary artery calcification and atherosclerosis\[6\].

It's important to note that serum magnesium levels may not accurately reflect total body magnesium status, as intracellular magnesium makes up more than 99% of total body magnesium\[8\]. This suggests that subclinical magnesium deficiency may be more prevalent than previously thought and could be a significant contributor to cardiovascular disease risk.

In conclusion, maintaining adequate magnesium levels through diet or supplementation may play a crucial role in preventing coronary plaque formation and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which magnesium deficiency contributes to atherosclerosis and to determine optimal strategies for magnesium supplementation in at-risk populations.
