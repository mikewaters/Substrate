# Pathological Demand Avoidance

> rns out, this is a known phenomenon, especially in autistic people. PDA isn’t just procrastination. It’s a neurological response where even small demands feel like a threat. 
>
> Studies show PDA is linked to heightened stress responses in the brain. Tasks trigger a "fight-or-flight" reaction instead of logical action. Paper: <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36892327/>
>
> For people with PDA, demands = loss of control = stress. Even if the demand comes from yourself, your brain rebels. For me, even something simple like “clean your room” felt like being trapped. It’s not about laziness—it’s about autonomy and survival instincts.

> The breakthrough: The ONE question that changed everything 
>
>  “How can I make this interesting?” That’s it. I stopped forcing myself and started hacking my brain to see every task as a challenge, an experiment, a game.

> "I need to clean my room." 
>
> "What if I time myself and try to break my record?" 

>  "I have to do a boring coding task." 
>
>  "How can I solve this in the weirdest, most creative way possible?" This one shift allowed me to build <http://PlayCode.io>, a unique, high-quality product. Because I HAD to make it interesting, or I wouldn’t do it. 

> The paradox: I will work 5x harder if I’m interested Funny thing? If I’m excited about something, I’ll go all in—even if it takes 5x the effort. That’s why my startup stands out. That’s why my product is so polished. Because I’m wired to make everything a fun challenge, or I can’t function at all.
