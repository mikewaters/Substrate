# Sample Data for Testing Resource-Topic Relationships
#
# This dataset specifically tests the resource_related_topics association table
# with resources that have BOTH related_resources AND related_topics.
#
# Dependencies:
# - Requires sample_taxonomies.yaml to be loaded first (for topics)

# Create a new catalog and repository to avoid conflicts
