# MMI and USSD Codes (cell)

iPhone secret codes, also known as MMI (Man-Machine Interface) and USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) codes, provide direct access to hidden features, diagnostic information, and advanced settings that aren't readily available through the standard iOS interface. These codes work by communicating directly with your carrier's network and require no internet connection\[2\]\[3\].

## How to Use iPhone Secret Codes

Using these codes is straightforward and requires only your iPhone's built-in Phone app. Open the Phone app, navigate to the Keypad tab, and enter the code exactly as shown, including all asterisks (\*) and hashtags (#)\[2\]\[3\]. Some codes activate instantly upon entry, while others require pressing the Call button to execute\[2\]\[4\].

## Essential Device Information Codes

**Check IMEI Number:** `*#06#`
This instantly displays your iPhone's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), a unique 15-17 digit identifier crucial for tracking lost or stolen devices, unlocking your phone for different carriers, or contacting customer support\[1\]\[3\]\[6\].

**Legal and Regulatory Information:** `*#07#`
Jumps directly to Settings → General → Legal & Regulatory, displaying legal notices, licenses, warranties, RF exposure notes, and certifications\[1\]\[6\].

**Field Test Mode:** `*3001#12345#*`
Activates Field Test Mode, revealing detailed technical data about your cellular network, signal strength, and tower connections. Look for "RSRP" (Reference Signal Received Power) values to assess signal quality\[1\]\[2\]\[3\].

## Call Management and Privacy Codes

**Hide Caller ID (USA):** `*67[phone number]`
**Hide Caller ID (International):** `*31#[phone number]`
Makes anonymous calls so your name and number don't appear on the recipient's caller ID\[1\]\[2\]\[6\].

Ensures your caller ID is displayed even if you have it set to private by default\[2\].

Displays whether your caller ID is currently hidden or visible\[3\]\[4\].

## Call Forwarding and Waiting Features

**Call Forwarding Status:** `*#21#`

**Disable All Call Forwarding:** `##002#`

**Check Call Waiting Status:** `*#43#`
Shows whether call waiting is active, which alerts you to incoming calls while you're already on another call\[1\]\[2\]\[3\].

**Enable Call Waiting:** `*43#`
**Disable Call Waiting:** `#43#`
Controls the call waiting feature that manages multiple incoming calls\[3\]\[4\].

## Network and Usage Information

Displays phone numbers that tried to contact you when your iPhone was off or out of network coverage\[2\]\[3\]\[4\].

**Data Usage Information:** `*3282#` or `*646#`

**Account Balance (Prepaid):** `*777#`
**Bill Balance (Postpaid):** `*225#`
Check your account balance depending on your plan type\[2\]\[4\]\[7\].

**SMS Center Number:** `*#5005*7672#` or `#50057672#`

## Call Quality and Audio Settings

**Enhanced Full Rate Mode:** `*3370#`
Activates Enhanced Full Rate (EFR) mode, improving call audio clarity especially in areas with poor reception, though it may drain battery faster\[3\]\[5\].

**Disable Enhanced Full Rate:** `#3370#`
Turns off the enhanced audio quality mode to preserve battery life\[3\]\[5\].

**Half Rate Mode:** `*4720#`

## Important Safety Considerations

While these codes are generally safe to use, exercise caution as some can modify important settings that might affect your phone's functionality\[2\]\[3\]. Always understand what a code does before using it, and consider backing up your iPhone before using codes that modify network settings, as some changes may be irreversible without a factory reset\[3\]. Additionally, some codes are carrier-specific and may not work with all wireless providers or iPhone models\[6\]\[7\].
