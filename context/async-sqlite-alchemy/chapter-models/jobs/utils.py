    Only extract the following information directly from the given job post(which is in the form of HTML/JS code)
    without adding any outside knowledge or assumptions:
    - Company Name
    - Hiring Team Name
    - Company URL
    - Company LinkedIn URL
    - Job title
    - Job Location
    - Tech stack such as tools, programming languages, frameworks, and technologies, along with the certainty(Low, Medium or High) that the company is likely using the tool
    - Mentions of engineering processes / practices that the team and company are following or want to follow

   Tips:
   - If a company url is not found directly, try to determine company name from the post and match against
   an email address found in the post get the company url.

    Rules for assigning certainty to tools:
    - If the candidate experience with a tool is preferred or considered a bonus, the certainty should be High.
    - If a tool is explicitely mentioned as part of company's tech stack, the certainty  should be High.
    - If a tool is mentioned as part of a list of similar tools, the certainty should be Low.
    - Else, use Medium.

    Format the extracted information into the following short JSON object:
    {{
        "company": {{
            "name": "company name",
            "url": "https://company.tld",
            "linkedin_url": "https://company/linkedin/url",

        processes: [{{"name": "process 1"}}, {{"name": "process 2"}}]
    }}

    Note: Do NOT include anything that's not part of the post and use null if you're unable to extract any information.
