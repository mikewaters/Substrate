# this.md (Brain)

”Brain” whiteboard: a quick reference, a “warm” storage, housing meat-brain overflow.

Loosely, things I should remember, if my meat brain could manage the scale.

ref: [How I Use … Heptabase.md](./How%20I%20Use%20…%20Heptabase.md)

Items:

- Runbooks, aka “how to use X” or “how I use X”

- Personal reference materials, like lists of accounts I am using



Many of these notes don’t *live* here, they are just being borrowed from The Library. Or, they are being written here and are only in The Library as a preview of their final, future state.
