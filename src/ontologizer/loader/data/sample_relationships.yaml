# Sample Data for Testing Association Table Relationships
#
# This dataset specifically tests the three many-to-many association tables:
# 1. catalog_taxonomies - Catalog to Taxonomy relationships
# 2. resource_related_resources - Resource to Resource relationships
# 3. resource_related_topics - Resource to Topic relationships
#
# Dependencies:
# - Requires sample_taxonomies.yaml to be loaded first (for taxonomies and topics)

# Catalog with taxonomy relationships (tests catalog_taxonomies table)
