# Prompt Routing Solutions

<https://github.com/katanemo/archgw>

> Prompts are nuanced and opaque user requests, which require the same capabilities as traditional HTTP requests including secure handling, intelligent routing, robust observability, and integration with backend (API) systems for personalization – outside core business logic.\*

> Arch is engineered with purpose-built LLMs to handle critical but pesky tasks related to the handling and processing of prompts.
