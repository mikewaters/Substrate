 frequently transfer files from some device to some cloud store or other destination; for example: iCloud, Dropbox, my NAS.

It is highly annoying to use these apps, as I do not know where to file the thing. I am also very bad at this in real life, but if I can figure a way to bolster my folder organizing skills **digitally**, then that is a meaningful addition to my life.

Examples:

1. I downloaded a software license file; while I have the key information stored in my Password Manager, I do not want to add file-based data to it as a matter of policy. For this reason, I store all software license files in Dropbox. (I also keep some license keys in my PKM, that is a WIp). I need to put that license key in the Software Licenses folder, but I do not remember what system its in and where in that system i need to put it. Do this for me. Figure out where to put some given file - on MacOS and iOS - or ask me if you aren’t sure. 

   1. It may be smart to drop [THIS.md.md](./THIS.md.md) into these folders, for metadata. Store the metadata with the data whenever possible.

2. In the above process, I move files around. I often forget to do this, or forgewt that I *have done it*, and because of this I usually have device \~/Downloads folders full of files that I probably should have saved (and maybe I did). Help me to mark or delete files that have been moved into their long-term store, in order to visually identify files that have not been stored but should be.

   1. Maybe instead of exactly that, there’s an easier way;
