# Chase Bank Tracking

To prevent your purchase history from being used for advertising by Chase Bank, you can take the following steps:

1. **Review Chase's Privacy Policy**: Familiarize yourself with Chase's privacy practices by reviewing their Online Privacy Policy. This document outlines how your information is collected, used, and shared\[1\].

2. **Opt-Out of Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA)**: Chase allows you to opt-out of certain types of online behavioral advertising. You can do this through the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance. Visit the website [youradchoices.com](youradchoices.com) to manage your preferences\[1\].

3. **Manage Communication Preferences**: You can opt-out of receiving promotional emails from Chase by following the instructions provided in those emails, typically found at the bottom of the message\[6\].

4. **Limit Information Sharing**: While Chase does not offer a direct opt-out for transaction data used in targeted advertising, you can limit some information sharing with affiliates and non-affiliates by following the instructions in the U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice\[6\].

5. **Contact Customer Service**: For more specific inquiries or assistance with privacy settings, consider contacting Chase customer service directly to express your concerns and seek further guidance.

It's important to note that while these steps can help limit some data sharing, they may not completely prevent your purchase history from being used for all types of advertising purposes, especially those integral to Chase's business operations.
