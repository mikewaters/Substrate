# Cortisol and Melatonin

Chatgpt4o

high cortisol levels at night can lower melatonin levels. **Cortisol and melatonin have an inverse relationship in regulating sleep-wake cycles.** Cortisol is typically higher in the morning to promote wakefulness and lower at night to allow for sleep. Melatonin, on the other hand, is usually low during the day and rises in the evening to prepare the body for sleep.

When cortisol levels are elevated at night, it can interfere with the production of melatonin, leading to difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. **Stress** and **irregular sleep patterns** are common **causes of elevated nighttime cortisol levels, which can disrupt the natural circadian rhythm and negatively impact sleep quality.**
