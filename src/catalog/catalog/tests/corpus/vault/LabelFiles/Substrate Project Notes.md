# Substrate Project Notes

- [ ] move this to github somehow - need an iphone editor

~~Resources can be added to Documents, and remember a Document is official. Something needs to be promoted to it.~~



~~Work can be in progress or just an idea, like “Getting my back healthy”. On second thought, maybe I need Deltas and the other stuff from Self, to distinguish the type of Activity (one of my biggest issues is Thing Sprawl.~~



~~A Document Collection might be useful, and in fact a Landscape could be so dieted a collection of app references. The moment a Landscape gets big enough for two documents, this falls apart without a Collection.~~ The collection could have unique metadata, like theme and topic and an index or ToC. Adding a new repo would be a new note in a collection of resources.

The Monolith Problem

Als Struggle with Large, Monolithic Codebases

The fundamental challenge isn't intelligence-it's context. Modern LLMs can't hold an entire enterprise application in their working memory simultaneously.

Scale Challenge

Most monoliths will take years to break up, even with Al assistance. The interdependencies run too deep.

Universal Problem

Almost every organization has at least one critical monolith that defines their core business operations.
