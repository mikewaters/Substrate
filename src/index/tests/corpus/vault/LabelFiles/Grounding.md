# Grounding

Is a:: Concept

In:: Information Management:Tactics

My particular defect is [Dont Have a Cue.md](./Dont%20Have%20a%20Cue.md), and so I need to create artificial cues, or place myself in a state where a cue is unnecessary.

One of [My KM Principles and Practices.md](../Whiteboard/My%20KM%20Principles%20and%20Practices.md) is that apps should facilitate Grounding, which loosely means a state transition from disconnected to connected to the cognitive structures that need to occupy my brain in order for me to use the knowledge manager. Said less stupidly, I forget what I’ve done, how I’ve organized the PKM, and so I need reminding - specifically, a cue to “unlock” that structural representation that is stored in my mind, but just isnt acccessible.

(aka ‘give me cues for remembering’).
