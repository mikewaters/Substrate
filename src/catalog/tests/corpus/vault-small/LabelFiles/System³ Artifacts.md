# System³ Artifacts

- [ ] “Artifact” is a shitty and not descriptive enough term; find a better one.

# Conceptual

> Input or output-framed data visualizations and data entry.
>
> For a given context, provides necessary data views and abilities.

Basically, Artifacts are the I/O of your life-business operations - the “database tables” and views/perspectives that assist you with maintaining and viewing information about your business current and future state. Call it a “second brain”, but with other reporting and ability dimensions.
