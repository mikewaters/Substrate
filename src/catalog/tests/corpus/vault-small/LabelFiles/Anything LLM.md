> AnythingLLM is an open-source AI tool by Mintplex Labs that turns anything into a trained chatbot you can query and chat with. AnythingLLM is a BYOK (bring-your-own-keys) software so there is no subscription

> All collections are organized into buckets we call "Workspaces". Workspaces are buckets of files, documents, images, PDFs, and other files which will be transformed into something LLM's can understand and use in conversation.
