# this.md (Library)

### What is this?

The Library is a home - a destination. I write things when I am thinking about them. When I am done writing them, if I am also done with thinking about them , I move them into The Library.

Checking out a $note is putting it on another board. It doesnt live in that other board.

### When should I use it?

While writing a $note, I can choose to add it to The Library prematurely.

When I am writing or updating a $note, it will probably be in [🧠 Brain.md](../Whiteboard/🧠%20Brain.md) (if I am only thinking) or [ 👨🏻‍💻 LifeOS.md](../Whiteboard/%20👨🏻‍💻%20LifeOS.md) (if I am also doing or planning to do).

### Landscapes

Ultimately, landscape docs will become part of the library; they can even start their life in a library board. To keep things organized however, I will have a whiteboard dedicated to landscapes that are “active”, so that similar types of research are in one place (even thogh I also use a tag to classify them).
