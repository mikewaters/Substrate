# MTHFR Notes

FRAT test

> @niamh_agali: I have ADHD (as well as two copies of MTHFR & COMT mutations) & I’ve been taking folinic acid for nearly a decade because a researcher/psychiatrist (Dr. Lisa Pan) presented about it at a conference I attended. Her research established that MTHFR & other metabolic gene mutations can play a role in treatment-resistant depression & the appropriate supplements for them (like folinic acid for MTHFR) can help decrease symptoms for many folks. Taking folinic acid increased my baseline mental health & immune system, while adenosylcobalamin (adeno b12) significantly increased my baseline energy in a noticeable & positive way. When I tried 5-MTHF, I experienced increased agitation/irritability just like your son, which is a pretty common side effect according to Dr. Pan, & it made me SO uncomfortable like I took too high of a dose of my stimulant. Dr. Pan actually recommended folinic acid over 5-MTHF when I talked to her after her presentation & she prescribes it for her patients who have treatment-resistant depression & the MTHFR mutation.

> @minds.of.all.kinds: Sorry for the confusion, my purpose was to say that BOTH folinic acid and 5-MTHF are good sources of folate supplementation. I was presenting stronger for 5-MTHF bc this video mentions 5-MTHF won't work. Several pediatric neurologists that are prescribing Leucovorin (folinic acid) are also using 5-MTHF. 

> @minds.of.all.kinds: "Treatment with either folinic acid or 5MTHF will preclude testing after administration because they correct deficient CSF 5MTHF levels." Dr. Lisa A. Pan also says that both are good sources!

> @minds.of.all.kinds: Folate is the connection! synthetic folate (Folic Acid) is being over used, over fortified in foods, and the main folate used in prenatal supplements/baby formulas. however research has been showing more and more that this synthetic folic acid is not being processed by our bodies. and the build of folic acid in the body is causing a pseudo-MTHFR effect. which is leading to lower levels of folate in the brain. several scientists have been trying to change the folate recommendation for pregnancy and infant formula to be changed to 5-MTHF because of this issue.
