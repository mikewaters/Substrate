# pipx

<https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/>

> pipx is a tool to help you install and run end-user applications written in Python. It's roughly similar to macOS's `brew`, JavaScript's [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b), and Linux's `apt`.

It turns any python package with a console entry point into a command line application.

From <https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/>:

- Expose CLI entrypoints of packages ("apps") installed to isolated environments with the `install` command. This guarantees no dependency conflicts and clean uninstalls!

- Easily list, upgrade, and uninstall packages that were installed with pipx

- Run the latest version of a Python application in a temporary environment with the `run` command
