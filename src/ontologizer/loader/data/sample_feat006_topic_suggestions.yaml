    title: Introduction to Slip Box Method
    description: |
      The Zettelkasten method is a personal knowledge management system developed by Niklas Luhmann.
      It involves creating atomic notes, each containing a single idea, and linking them together.
      The key principles are: one idea per note, use your own words, and create connections between notes.
      Luhmann used physical index cards (Zettel means slip or card in German), but modern implementations
      use digital tools like Obsidian or Roam Research. The method emphasizes thinking through writing
      and building a network of interconnected ideas over time.

    title: Evidence-Based Learning Techniques
    description: |
      Research shows that the most effective learning techniques are spaced repetition and active recall.
      Spaced repetition means reviewing material at increasing intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, etc.).
      Active recall involves testing yourself rather than just rereading. Studies by Bjork and others
      demonstrate these methods dramatically improve long-term retention compared to passive review.
      Combining both techniques creates a powerful learning system. Tools like Anki implement these
      principles through flashcards with scheduling algorithms.

    title: My Personal Productivity System
    description: |
      I've developed a hybrid system combining several methodologies. I use time blocking every morning
      to schedule my day, breaking it into focused work sessions. During work sessions, I apply the
      Pomodoro technique with 25-minute intervals followed by 5-minute breaks. For task management,
      I follow GTD principles: capture everything, clarify next actions, organize by context.
      The combination helps me maintain focus while ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.
      I review weekly to adjust and refine the system.

    title: Using Mind Maps for Visual Thinking
    description: |
      Mind mapping is a visual technique for organizing information radiating from a central concept.
      Tony Buzan popularized the method in the 1970s. A mind map starts with a central idea and branches
      out into related subtopics, using colors, images, and keywords. This visual structure mirrors how
      the brain naturally associates ideas. Mind maps are excellent for brainstorming, planning projects,
      and studying complex topics. They can be created on paper or using digital tools like MindMeister
      or XMind. The non-linear format encourages creative thinking and helps reveal connections.

    repository: repo:local-notes
    title: Conducting a Systematic Literature Review
    description: |
      A literature review requires systematic methodology. Start by defining your research question
      and search terms. Use academic databases like Google Scholar, JSTOR, and PubMed. As you find
      relevant papers, maintain detailed notes including key findings, methodology, and limitations.
      Use citation management software like Zotero or Mendeley to organize references. Create a
      synthesis matrix to compare studies. Take research notes that connect ideas across papers
      rather than just summarizing each one. The goal is to identify gaps, trends, and opportunities
      for future research while building a coherent narrative.

    title: Setting Up Obsidian for Research
    description: |
      Obsidian is a powerful tool for building a personal knowledge base. I use it with the following
      plugins: Dataview for queries, Calendar for daily notes, Templater for note templates, and
      Citations for managing research papers. My folder structure separates permanent notes, literature
      notes, and fleeting notes. I use tags sparingly, preferring links to build connections. The graph
      view helps visualize the network of ideas. For research, I create literature notes with citations
      and link them to relevant permanent notes that capture my own thinking.

    title: Academic Research Note-Taking Workflow
    description: |
      My research workflow combines digital tools with systematic note-taking. I use Roam Research
      for networked note-taking, implementing Zettelkasten principles. Each paper gets a literature
      note with proper citations managed in Zotero. As I read, I create atomic notes for key concepts,
      always in my own words. I link these to related ideas using bidirectional links. For spaced
      repetition, I extract key facts into Anki flashcards. The combination of networked notes and
      active recall creates a powerful system for academic work.

    title: Cornell Note-Taking in Lectures
    description: |
      The Cornell method divides the page into three sections: notes, cues, and summary. During the
      lecture, take notes in the main area using abbreviations and diagrams. After class, write
      questions or keywords in the cue column. At the bottom, write a brief summary in your own words.
      This structure forces active processing and creates built-in review material. The cue column
      is perfect for self-testing by covering the notes and trying to answer the questions. I've found
      this especially effective for classes with heavy conceptual content rather than problem-solving.

    title: Building an Integrated Learning System
    description: |
      An effective learning system integrates multiple techniques. I combine the Zettelkasten method
      for knowledge management with spaced repetition for memorization. When I learn something new,
      I create an atomic note in Obsidian and add flashcards to Anki for key facts. I review notes
      weekly and flashcards daily. For elaboration, I write my own examples and connect new concepts
      to what I already know. Time blocking ensures I dedicate time to learning daily. The Pomodoro
      technique helps maintain focus during study sessions. This multi-faceted approach addresses
      different aspects of learning: understanding, retention, and application.

    title: Implementing Pomodoro at Work
    description: |
      Started using the Pomodoro technique this week. Setting 25-minute timers for focused work.
      Taking 5-minute breaks to stretch and rest eyes. After 4 pomodoros, taking a longer 15-30 minute
      break. Finding it helps avoid burnout and maintains energy throughout the day. The time constraint
      creates a sense of urgency that improves focus. Tracking how many pomodoros per task helps
      estimate future work better.

    title: Advanced Zettelkasten Techniques
    description: |
      Beyond basic atomic notes, advanced Zettelkasten practice includes several techniques.
      Structure notes act as entry points into topics, providing an overview and links to related
      notes. Hub notes connect related atomic notes into a coherent sequence. Index notes help
      navigate the system. The principle of elaboration means always writing notes in your own words
      and making connections explicit. Progressive summarization involves highlighting key points
      over multiple passes. These advanced techniques help scale the system as it grows to thousands
      of notes.

    title: Feynman Technique for Learning
    description: |
      Article about the Feynman Technique - a learning method where you explain a concept in simple
      terms as if teaching a child. Named after physicist Richard Feynman. Steps: 1) Choose a concept,
      2) Teach it to someone unfamiliar, 3) Identify gaps in your understanding, 4) Review and simplify.
      The act of simplifying reveals whether you truly understand something. Similar to elaboration
      and active recall in its effectiveness.
