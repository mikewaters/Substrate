# Heptabase Markdown Import

Is a:: IEffort, Note

Effort status:: Complete

We are able to export data from other systems into Markdown files and then import them. This misses most metadata though, and so I shouldn’t spend much more time here.

I have created a set of test .md files to validate the native Heptabase Markdown imports. The most comprehensive on, at last I checked, was Obsidian; it was able to get some data into Heptabase via markdown front matter. However, it did not work for all entities (like tags, properties etc). ref: `/Users/mike/Develop/Heptabase Hacking`
