# Possible Decline of Western Software

The “fully incomprehensible to humans” aspect of this potential future state interests me as a software person. 

The last 50 years of software evolution have been driven by a need to scale human comprehension for larger and more integrated codebases. If we decreasingly need/rely on humans to understand our code, source code’s forward-progress flywheel is going to slow down and will bring us closer to (as you suggest) incomprehensibility.

Not only did we scale the breadth of codebases - the flywheel built layers and layers of abstraction over time (have you seen the code sample in this article??), fostering a growing market of professional developers and their career progressions; if most code becomes incomprehensible, itll be the code closer to “the bottom”, a thin wrapper of API on top of an expanding mass of throwaway whatever-language AlphaAlgo creates. 

If we don’t wrangle this, it will destroy a profession and leave us with trillions of LoC that only people with GPUs can understand. Which may be another profession I suppose.
