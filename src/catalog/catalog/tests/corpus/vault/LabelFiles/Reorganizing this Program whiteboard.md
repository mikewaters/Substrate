## Capture

Definitions of [Process.md](./Process.md) and [Routine.md](./Routine.md) types

### External Inputs (ABSTRACT)

Invalid section

- User Interfaces

   - web browser, Pod Catcher etc

   - *a user of the system would select an instance/implementation of this*

- Capabilities

   - transcription, book library sync, share sheet (concrete?),  annotation tool

- Input Types

   - code sample, article, etc

### Workflows

Invalid section section

- Reference, Idea, and Work management 

### Processes

*sorta abstract, in that the system user would define the details of them, or choose not to use tme*

- Routines

- Studying, inbox check

### Artifacts (User Interfaces?)

*This contains both abstract and concrete, as well as a description card* [System³ Artifacts.md](./System³%20Artifacts.md)

- what apps I use

- **where the artifacts live in the life business flow**

### Control Plane (todo: rename)

*Includes the data plane, and is not much different than Artifacts section.*

*Artifacts (User Intefraces) are those tools or capabilities that support the execution of processes.  As do the External Inputs.*

*Then I have some inside-baseball about components that implement those capabilities*
