Is a:: Solution [Solution Definition Document.md](./Solution%20Definition%20Document.md)

## File cabinet desk that knows everything and has access to all my info tools

*Is a:: Solution*

It knows everything but only surfaces what I need to see right now. It can go and seek out information itself, and consolidate information I am collecting. It keeps my info tools clean so I can focus on what’s important but still experience the excitement of future things without them bogging me down.

It not only maintains a research library and a study and thinking space, but serves as memory helper to keep important but not urgent information at my fingertips
