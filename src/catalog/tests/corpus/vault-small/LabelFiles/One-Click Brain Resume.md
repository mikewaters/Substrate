# One-Click Brain Resume

### Memory helper: efforts

I have hundreds of things happening at once, and this “Open Loops” problem causes:

- Inability to easily resume - a friction that is high enough to make me shy away from it due to [Anxiety Loops.md](./Anxiety%20Loops.md), and continue to procrastinate. 

   - Friction resuming an effort that’s been tabled for some time, because I do not know where “all the things!” are for that effort. Tasks, notes, snippets etc

- Unable to recall the name of an effort, which is needed to file something relevant away when I do not have time to search

- Recalling *why* I am prioritizing some individual effort; I capture Problems, and Solutions, but do not relate them well enough.

[The Open Loops (Problem).md](./The%20Open%20Loops%20\(Problem\).md)

Solution 2: [One-Click Brain Resume.md](./One-Click%20Brain%20Resume.md)

1. the data allows me to easily resume using automation

2. the data can be queried using natural language

3. Depends on [Plannerizer.md](./Plannerizer.md)

## Effort(s) Overview

As a person with memory issues, provide me with a way to save the state of some effort so that I can easily access it later.
