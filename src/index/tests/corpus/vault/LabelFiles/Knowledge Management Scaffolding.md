# Knowledge Management Scaffolding

gpt-5 and Mike

Knowledge Management (KM) does **not sit inside** any single layer of our [Ontological–Epistemic Framework of Existence.md](./Ontological–Epistemic%20Framework%20of%20Existence.md).

Instead, it is **orthogonal** — it *operates across all layers* to mediate between **ontology (what is)** and **epistemology (how it is known and organized)**.

- KM manages **representations, relations, and processes** that span **Ontological facts**, **Phenomenological experiences**, and **Epistemic structures**.

- It doesn’t introduce new ontological kinds — it governs *how instances, relations, and knowledge about them are created, stored, and maintained*.

So, you can think of KM as a **meta-layer or scaffolding** that overlays the existing structure.

## **How Knowledge Management Relates to Each Layer**

| **Framework Layer** | **KM Function** | 
|---|---|
| **Ontological** | Captures data about *entities, things, states, and events* — the “raw world facts.” (E.g., a database record noting that “Jug #42 has temperature 100°C.”) | 
| **Epistemic** | Stores and organizes *concepts, categories, taxonomies, and schemas* — the ontological models and vocabularies that make data meaningful. | 
| **Onto-Relational** | Defines and maintains *links and dependencies* among knowledge elements (e.g., causal graphs, semantic relations, ontological mappings). | 
| **Phenomenological** | Records *human perspectives, interpretations, and experiences* of entities and events (e.g., “the user perceives the jug as hot”). | 
| **Abstract / Logical** | Provides *formal models, reasoning rules, and inference structures* (e.g., OWL axioms, logical constraints, type hierarchies). | 

In this sense, KM serves as the **“meta-infrastructure”** connecting all levels — ensuring that **instances, states, relations, and appearances** can be stored and retrieved as *structured knowledge.*

## **How to Think About KM in Practice**

If we map KM to implementation functions:

| **KM Function** | **Relation to Framework** | 
|---|---|
| **Ontology Management** | Manages *the formal structure of entities, relations, and categories* → aligns with the Ontological and Abstract layers. | 
| **Information Architecture** | Organizes *concepts, topics, and taxonomies* → aligns with the Epistemic layer. | 
| **Knowledge Representation** | Defines *how knowledge is modeled and encoded* (triples, ontologies, graphs) → bridges Ontological ↔ Epistemic. | 
| **Knowledge Capture and Curation** | Collects instances of *events, states, and experiences* → bridges Phenomenological ↔ Ontological. | 
| **Knowledge Flow and Use** | Governs *how knowledge is accessed, shared, and acted upon* (activities, goals) → ties into Dasein’s pragmatic world. |

## **Visual Relationship**

 ├── Phenomenal   ←────────────── Documents experiences, interpretations
 └── Logical      ←────────────── Encodes reasoning, rules, constraints
```

## **Summary**

> **Knowledge Management** does not *reside* in the framework;

> it **acts upon and across it** — as the **operational and semantic infrastructure** that stores, relates, and manages instances of being, appearance, and understanding.



So practically:

- A KM system stores *ontological data* (facts about jugs, legs, onions),

- *epistemic structures* (concepts, taxonomies),

- *phenomenological traces* (user experiences),

- and *logical constraints* (rules, reasoning models).



It is thus best conceived as **an orthogonal system** that **enables persistence, retrieval, and reasoning** *about the framework’s contents* — rather than another layer *within* it.
