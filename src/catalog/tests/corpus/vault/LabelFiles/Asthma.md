# Asthma

Seneca:

> Seneca describes his chronic asthma: 
>
> 'I have been dealt one illness in particular, which the Greeks call 'asthma' meaning 'short of breath'. Attacks usually last an hour or so – can you imagine drawing your final breath for that long?

>  I have been visited by many types of physical pain but none are more distressing than this; with other ailments you might suffer sickness but with asthma you feel you are losing your very soul's breath. For this reason, doctors call asthma a 'rehearsal for death'..

> The laboured breathing becomes a gasping that lasts for long intervals, and even when it abates I cannot rejoice: for this is a case you never win, you merely postpone the day of the trial..

> When the attack ends my breathing still does not flow naturally, almost as if there is some obstruction. So take my word for it: when my final moment does come, I won't be afraid. I am rehearsing it every day.'

> Seneca, Moral Letters, 54. (c.63-65 AD)
