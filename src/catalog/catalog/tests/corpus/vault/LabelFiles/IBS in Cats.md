# IBS in Cats

Feeding a cat with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) or IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) can be tricky, but many cats do achieve minimal or even zero symptoms with the right diet. While there is no one-size-fits-all food, here are the most effective approaches:

**1\. Novel Protein Diets**

Cats with IBD often react to common proteins like chicken, beef, or fish. A novel protein is one your cat has never eaten before, such as:

- Rabbit

- Venison

- Duck

- Pork

- Kangaroo (in some regions)

Recommended Brands:

- Instinct LID (Limited Ingredient Diet) Rabbit

- Royal Canin Selected Protein PR (Rabbit)

- Natural Balance LID Duck & Green Pea

**2\. Hydrolyzed Protein Diets**

In hydrolyzed diets, proteins are broken down into tiny pieces that don’t trigger immune reactions.

- Purina Pro Plan Veterinary Diets HA

- Royal Canin Hydrolyzed Protein

- Hill’s z/d

These are usually prescription diets and often work very well for IBD.

**3\. Low-Fat, Easily Digestible Diets**

High fat can worsen diarrhea. Look for:

- Boiled chicken or turkey breast (skinless, boneless)

- Mashed pumpkin (plain, not pie filling)

- White rice or potato (small amounts)\
   These are good bland diets for flare-ups.

**4\. Grain-Free and Additive-Free Foods**

Grains and fillers like corn, soy, wheat, and artificial dyes may aggravate symptoms.

Choose:

- Foods with 1–2 whole ingredients max

- Wet food (higher moisture helps digestion)

Examples:

- Ziwi Peak (Air-dried or canned, single protein)

- Hound & Gatos

- Weruva Paw Lickin’ Chicken (though chicken can be a trigger)

**5\. Supplements That Can Help**

- Probiotics: Fortiflora, Visbiome Vet, or Proviable

- Slippery Elm Bark: natural anti-inflammatory (consult your vet)

- Omega-3s (from fish oil): reduce gut inflammation

- B12 injections: often low in IBD cats

**Trial and Error is Necessary**

Each cat’s IBD is unique. You may need to try 2–3 diets before finding one that works perfectly. Transition slowly (over 7–10 days) and monitor stools and behavior.

**Can Symptoms Be 100% Eliminated**

Yes—some cats become fully asymptomatic on the right diet, especially if IBD is caught early and there’s no lasting intestinal damage. However, stress, sudden diet changes, or even weather can trigger minor flares.
