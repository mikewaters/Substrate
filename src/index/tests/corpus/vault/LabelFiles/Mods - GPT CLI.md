/LLM based AI is really good at interpreting the output of commands and returning the results in CLI friendly text formats like Markdown. Mods is a simple tool that makes it super easy to use AI on the command line and in your pipelines. Mods works with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys), [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service), and [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI)
