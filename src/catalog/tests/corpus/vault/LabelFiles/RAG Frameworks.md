# RAG Frameworks

Was:: Evaluating RAG Frameworks

Parent:: [RAG.md](./RAG.md)

I am evaluating RAG frameworks to use for my LifeOS. I’ve narrowed down/whittled out options to these.

## To read

- [ ] [More rag.md](./More%20rag.md)

- [ ] [Local rag.md](./Local%20rag.md)

- [ ] [RAG.md](./RAG.md)

## Frameworks/Libraries

### Mirascope

<https://www.mirascope.io>

<https://github.com/mirascope/mirascope>

Not a RAG framework, more of a lower layer that abstracts out LLM stuff.

Integrated with FastAPI

### Pytube

[YouTube Downloaders.md](./YouTube%20Downloaders.md)

Youtube downloader library

<https://github.com/pytube/pytube>

### Mem0

Memory for LLM chats

<https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0?tab=readme-ov-file>

<https://docs.mem0.ai/examples/overview>

### Langroid

<https://github.com/langroid/langroid>

> Langroid is an intuitive, lightweight, extensible and principled Python framework to easily build LLM-powered applications, from ex-CMU and UW-Madison researchers. You set up Agents, equip them with optional components (LLM, vector-store and tools/functions), assign them tasks, and have them collaboratively solve a problem by exchanging messages. This Multi-Agent paradigm is inspired by the Actor Framework (but you do not need to know anything about this!).
>
> Langroid is a fresh take on LLM app-development, where considerable thought has gone into simplifying the developer experience; it does not use Langchain.

### R2R

“The Supabase of RAG”

### LLamaindex

[Llamaindex rag.md](./Llamaindex%20rag.md) 

Looks interesting, they follow a plugin model and there are many plugins at [LLamaHub](https://llamahub.ai)

### Txtai

[txtai.md](./txtai.md)

### Haystack

## Monitoring

The Langchain guys (Datastax as well as other biggies have integrated moniotinrg, but there are some pluggable frameworks
