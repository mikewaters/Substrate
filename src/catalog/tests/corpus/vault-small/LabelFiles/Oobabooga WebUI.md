# Oobabooga WebUI

<https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui>

Similar to [Open-WebUI.md](./Open-WebUI.md), but less focused on local models and more focused on model support and configuration:

- Supports more model formats and frameworks

- More extensive training and fine-tuning capabilities

- More detailed model parameter controls

- Built-in character creation tools

- More extensive prompt templates system

- Better support for instruction-tuning

Mostly aligned with character development.
