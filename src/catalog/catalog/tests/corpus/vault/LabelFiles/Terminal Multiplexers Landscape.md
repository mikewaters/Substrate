# Terminal Multiplexers Landscape

Wezterm supports project workspaces, which I am currently using. Given I may not be sticking with it (love GhosTTY) I’ll need something else.

May be smart to stick with tmux given Ive used it before, but if I were to move it would be to Zellij.

**Requirements:**

- persistent sessions across physical machines and locations

### Tmux

### Zellij

> Zellij is a terminal workspace. It has the base functionality of a terminal multiplexer (similar to `tmux` or `screen`) but includes many built-in features that would allow users to extend it and create their own personalized environment.

### Wezterm

I am currently using [WezTerm.md](./WezTerm.md) with Tmux keybindings, but this is only going to give me session persistence locally.
