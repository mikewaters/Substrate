# Retrieving Digital Books and Audio

## Audible

### Libation

<https://github.com/rmcrackan/Libation>

> Libation: Liberate your Library

Can run this as a service.

### OpenAudible

I have purchased a lifetime license, but this sems to require a UI. I might want to use Libation if I am running this in the backend.

This strips DRM [DRM Digital Rights Management.md](./DRM%20Digital%20Rights%20Management.md)

### Audiobookshelf

<https://www.audiobookshelf.org/guides/>

This is a “book server”, but also supports some other retrieval-based stuff
