# Windmill

Look very similar to the script builder portion of <https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill>, but not open-source, not self-hostable, without open-source integrations (<https://hub.windmill.dev/>) and without a workflow engine

 disclaimer: I'm founder of ^

Concepts: <https://www.windmill.dev/docs/core_concepts>

Code: <https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill>

**Open-source** developer platform and workflow engine

Turn scripts into auto-generated UIs, APIs and cron jobs.

Compose them as workflows or data pipelines.

Build complex, data-intensive UIs with ease.

Make your scripts production grade and build all of your internal tools with Python, Typescript, Go, Bash, Sql. 

### SO FUCKING COOL
