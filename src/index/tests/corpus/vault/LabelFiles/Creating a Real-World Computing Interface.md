# Creating a Real-World Computing Interface

Tangible Computing, Tangible Interfaces, Tangible Programs

## Idea: Physical Digital Todo List

- A receipt printer that generates todo lists that can be stuck anywhere

- computer vision analyzes the printouts for changes.

## Idea: Folk Computer

> ++[Folk](https://folk.computer/)++ is a physical computing system: reactive database, programming environment, projection mapping. Instead of a phone/laptop/touchscreen/mouse/keyboard, your computational objects are physical objects in the real world, and you can program them inside the system itself.

- A projector displays physical interfaces on surfaces

- The interfaces can be interacted with using QR codes that serve as kinda mouse pointers
