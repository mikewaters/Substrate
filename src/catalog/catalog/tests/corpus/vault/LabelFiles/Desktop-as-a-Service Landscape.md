# Desktop-as-a-Service Landscape

Kasm

Kasm is an open source, browser-based workspace streaming platform that enables secure, containerized access to desktops, applications, and browsers directly from any web browser. Its key technology leverages Docker-based containers to deliver isolated, disposable environments for tasks such as Remote Browser Isolation (RBI), Desktop as a Service (DaaS), and open-source intelligence (OSINT) workloads. The rendering engine for these graphical containers is provided by the open source project KasmVNC, allowing full desktop experiences over the web without needing any local installation.\[1\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]

### Core Features and Architecture

- Kasm allows users to stream entire operating systems, browsers, or custom applications as isolated containers, making each session private and reducing the risk of endpoint compromise.\[3\]\[7\]

- It supports rapid deployment and scaling for both individuals and enterprises, with automation and orchestration powered by Docker and modern DevOps patterns.\[4\]\[5\]

- Workspaces can be self-hosted, used in hybrid clouds, or offered as SaaS, making it highly adaptable for different infrastructures.\[8\]\[3\]

- The platform provides developer APIs for customizing workspaces, workflow automation, and integration with existing systems.\[8\]\[4\]

### Security and Use Cases

- Kasm is widely used in cybersecurity, secure collaboration, OSINT collection, remote administration, and regulatory-compliant environments, driven by its zero-trust approach and session isolation.\[7\]\[1\]\[4\]

- The containers are destroyed after each session, protecting identity, preventing persistence, and supporting anonymous research or sensitive digital activities.\[1\]\[7\]

- Features include document management, collaboration tools, and secure access to internal resources without requiring VPNs or local endpoint security agents.\[5\]\[8\]

### Open Source Components

- Kasm’s main open source technologies include its Docker workspace images and KasmVNC, available for direct customization on Docker Hub and GitHub.\[6\]\[9\]\[10\]

- Community Edition is free for individual and non-profit use, with extensive documentation and support available for self-hosting.\[3\]\[4\]

Kasm stands out for enabling secure, ephemeral, and highly configurable access to containerized desktops and applications, supporting a broad range of privacy-focused and enterprise use cases.\[2\]\[7\]\[3\]
