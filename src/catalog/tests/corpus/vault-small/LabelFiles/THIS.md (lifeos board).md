# THIS.md (lifeos board)

This is a top-down representation of goings-on and future plans. It’s mostly focused on items that have a [Currency.md](./Currency.md), and should therefore be on or [near one’s mind.md](./near%20one’s%20mind.md). From a domain scope this is considered [Work.md](./Work.md), and in another system might be named that.

There are other representations that cross-cut through this and other domains, like Future, Information, Self etc.
