# Recipe RSO

Below is an example â€œhomeâ€brewâ€ formulation that combines RSO with carrier oils and penetrationâ€enhancing excipients. Please note: This recipe is offered for informational and educational purposes only. I am not a licensed medical or cosmetic formulator, and you should perform your own research, testing (including a patch test), and consult with professionals (and comply with all local laws and regulations) before using or selling any product that contains active cannabis extracts and potent solvents like DMSO.



In particular, DMSO is a very active penetration enhancer that can carry not only your active ingredients but also impurities through the skin. Use it only at low concentrations and with caution.



Below is one sample formulation designed for a 100â€‘gram batch. (You may equally work by weight or volume.) Adjustments may be needed for your particular RSOâ€™s potency and your skinâ€™s tolerance.

Sample Cannabinoid-Enhanced Skin Oil



Ingredients & Suggested Percentages

â€¢ Carrier Oil (MCT oil or Jojoba oil): 80% (80 g)

Provides a lightweight, nonâ€greasy base.

â€¢ RSO (Rick Simpson Oil): 10% (10 g)

Contains the active cannabinoids. (Ensure your RSO is decarboxylated if you desire activated cannabinoids.)

â€¢ Oleic Acid: 3% (3 g)

A fatty acid known to disrupt the stratum corneum lipids slightly, helping penetration.

â€¢ DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide): 5% (5 g)

A powerful, waterâ€soluble penetration enhancer; keep concentration low.

â€¢ Polysorbate 80: 1% (1 g)

A nonionic emulsifier that helps to â€œbridgeâ€ the more polar DMSO into the oily phase for a more uniform mixture.

â€¢ Vitamin E (Tocopherol): 1% (1 g)

Acts as an antioxidant to help protect the oil from rancidity and may provide mild skin benefits.



Total: 100 g



Optional: Some formulators add a very small amount (1â€“2%) of highâ€‘grade ethanol as an additional solubilizer/penetration enhancer. However, because ethanol can be drying or irritating for some skin typesâ€”and because mixing polar solvents with oils is trickyâ€”this recipe omits ethanol unless you have experience with such emulsions.

Method of Assembly

1\. Sanitize Your Equipment and Workspace:

Ensure that all glassware, spatulas, and mixing vessels are clean and, ideally, sterilized.

2\. Warm the Oils Gently (Optional):

You may gently warm the carrier oil (and even the RSO, if very viscous) in a water bath (no more than 40â€“45Â°C/104â€“113Â°F) to aid mixing. Do not heat DMSO.

3\. Combine the Lipophilic Ingredients:

â€¢ In a clean mixing beaker, add the MCT (or Jojoba) oil.

â€¢ Stir in the RSO.

â€¢ Add the oleic acid.

â€¢ Optionally, add Vitamin E at this stage.

4\. Emulsifier Addition:

â€¢ Sprinkle in the Polysorbate 80 and stir thoroughly. This ingredient helps â€œsolubilizeâ€ the DMSO within the oil phase.

5\. Incorporate DMSO:

â€¢ Slowly add the measured DMSO while stirring continuously. Because DMSO is polar, thorough mixing is important. If you see any signs of separation, continue to stir or consider a brief sonication if available.

6\. Mixing and Homogenization:

â€¢ Continue stirring for several minutes. A magnetic stirrer or vortex mixer can help achieve a more uniform blend.

â€¢ If you decide to add a tiny amount of ethanol as an extra coâ€solvent, mix it in very slowly at this stage.

7\. Cool and Package:

â€¢ Allow the mixture to return to room temperature.

â€¢ Transfer the finished product into a dark glass dropper or pump bottle to minimize light exposure.

â€¢ Label your batch with ingredients, date, and any warnings.

Usage & Caution

â€¢ Patch Test: Always test on a small area of skin first to check for irritation, especially because DMSO can carry other compounds into the skin.

â€¢ Application: Use sparingly and avoid applying on broken or irritated skin.

â€¢ Storage: Store in a cool, dark place. Use within a reasonable period (typically within 3â€“6 months), as natural oils can go rancid.

Additional Notes on Penetration Enhancement

â€¢ Oleic Acid & DMSO: Both are wellâ€‘documented penetration enhancers. Oleic acid disturbs lipid packing in the stratum corneum, while DMSO increases skin permeability.

â€¢ Polysorbate 80: Although primarily included to help mix the polar and nonpolar phases, it may also aid in a more even distribution of the actives.

â€¢ Other Enhancers: Some formulators experiment with natural terpenes (like dâ€‘limonene) or phospholipids (like lecithin) to further boost transdermal delivery. However, these may increase the risk of irritation and should be introduced only after thorough testing.

Final Reminder



This formulation is experimental. Variations in RSO concentration, carrier oil choice, and personal skin sensitivity can dramatically affect both efficacy and safety. Always err on the side of caution, and if you plan to use or distribute such a product, consider consulting a cosmetic chemist or dermatologist and ensuring compliance with all local legal regulations.



By following these guidelines and testing carefully, you can explore a formulation that may help facilitate the transdermal delivery of cannabinoids.
