1. **Sensory Sensitivity**: Some neurodivergent individuals might experience heightened sensitivity to visual stimuli. This can include sensitivity to bright lights, certain colors, or rapidly changing scenes, which can be overwhelming or even painful. Visual adaptation for these individuals might involve creating environments with softer lighting, muted colors, or fewer visual distractions.

2. **Preference for Particular Visual Inputs**: Neurodivergent individuals may have preferences or aversions to specific visual patterns or stimuli. For instance, some might find comfort in symmetry, certain textures, or specific repetitive patterns. Adapting visual environments to align with these preferences can help reduce anxiety and increase comfort.

3. **Differences in Visual Processing**: Neurodivergent individuals may process visual information differently. For example, some might excel in visual-spatial tasks, seeing patterns and relationships in data or images that others might not. Conversely, others might struggle with processing too much visual information at once or may have difficulty interpreting facial expressions and body language.

4. **Accommodations and Tools**: Adaptations can include the use of visual supports such as icons, visual schedules, or simplified graphics to help in understanding and organizing information. Technology like screen readers, color overlays for reading, or augmented reality devices can also play a role in adapting visual inputs to better suit individual needs.

5. **Educational and Workplace Modifications**: In educational settings, visual adaptations might involve the use of specific types of visual presentations or the avoidance of visually cluttered worksheets and slides. In the workplace, adjustments might include the layout of the physical environment or the design of computer interfaces to be more accessible.
