- [ ] Debug the nest doorbell issues

A Nest doorbell going offline specifically when someone is at the door typically indicates a power supply issue related to the doorbell's internal battery or chime system. This problem is common in wired models but can also affect battery-powered versions under certain conditions. Here's how to diagnose and resolve it:

## Primary Cause: Insufficient Power During Chime Activation

Wired Nest doorbells rely on a small **internal battery** to maintain operation when the doorbell button is pressed. This battery compensates for power diverted to the mechanical chime. If the battery fails or the transformer lacks sufficient capacity, pressing the doorbell causes a temporary power loss, forcing the device to reboot\[4\]\[6\].

### Key Fixes:

1. **Disable the Mechanical Chime**  

   - In the Google Home app:  

      - Tap your doorbell’s tile → **Settings** → **Doorbell** → Toggle **Indoor chime** to **Off**\[6\].  

   - Use Google/Nest speakers or displays as chimes instead\[4\]\[6\].

2. **Upgrade Your Transformer**  

   - Replace the existing doorbell transformer with a **16-24V AC, 20-30VA** model to ensure stable power during chime activation\[4\]\[6\].

3. **Check Wi-Fi Stability**  

   - Ensure a strong signal (≥-65 dBm) at the doorbell’s location.  

   - Use a Wi-Fi extender or mesh system if signal strength is weak\[1\]\[5\].  

   - Reduce interference from devices like microwaves or baby monitors\[1\]\[3\].

4. **Test/Replace the Internal Battery**  

   - For wired models: A failing internal battery (common after 2-3 years) may require replacement.

## Additional Troubleshooting

- **Battery-Powered Models**: Ensure full charge and check for extreme temperature exposure\[2\]\[5\].  

- **Software Updates**: Confirm firmware is current via the Google Home app\[1\].  

- **Factory Reset**: Perform if connectivity issues persist (hold reset button for 10 seconds)\[3\]\[5\].  

If these steps fail, contact Google Support for hardware diagnostics\[1\]\[3\]. Persistent issues may indicate a faulty doorbell requiring replacement.
