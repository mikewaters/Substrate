Wikipedia:

In [multi-objective optimization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-objective_optimization "Multi-objective optimization"), the **Pareto front**(also called **Pareto frontier** or **Pareto curve**) is the set of all [Pareto efficient](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficient "Pareto efficient") solutions.[\[1\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front#cite_note-1) The concept is widely used in [engineering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering").[\[2\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front#cite_note-2): 111–148  It allows the designer to restrict attention to the set of efficient choices, and to make [tradeoffs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade-off "Trade-off") within this set, rather than considering the full range of every parameter.[\[3\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front#cite_note-3): 63–65 [\[4\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front#cite_note-4): 399–412

Example of a Pareto frontier. The boxed points represent feasible choices, and smaller values are preferred to larger ones. Point *C* is not on the Pareto frontier because it is dominated by both point *A* and point *B*. Points *A* and *B* are not strictly dominated by any other, and hence lie on the frontier.

+ Even in the best case, readability just becomes a Pareto frontier\[0\], given by expressive limits of the dominant programming paradigm - same single plaintext source code for all. There's only so much complexity, so much cross-cutting concerns, we can cram into the same piece of plaintext, until something gives, until the same code is beatiful to you one week, and incomprehensible the next week, with the only thing that changed is the type of work you're doing on it.
