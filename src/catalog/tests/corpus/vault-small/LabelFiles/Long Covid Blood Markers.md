   > Those complications can be wide-ranging and affect all kinds of organs, with **symptoms including chronic fatigue, intense pain, trouble breathing, difficulty sleeping, cardiovascular issues and cognitive problems commonly called “brain fog.”**

   > In the first two studies, recently published in the *++[Journal of Autoimmunity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089684112400101X)++* and *++[Frontiers in Immunology](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1443363/full)++, *the researchers looked at two sets of subjects: 78 patients with severe long COVID symptoms and 58 people who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 but fully recovered without any complications.

   > Elahi and his team looked at various immune cells and proteins in the blood of the study participants. They discovered that the long COVID group had higher levels of immune cells called neutrophils and monocytes that cause inflammation, and fewer protective lymphocytes. They also had more worn-out or exhausted killer T cells, which are a key part of the immune system’s defence against infections.

   > In the blood of the long COVID patients, the team also found higher levels of various proteins related to systemic inflammation — especially galectin-9 and artemin. These two proteins could help solve the mysteries of long COVID, Elahi says, because **higher levels of galectin-9 in patients are associated with increased inflammation and brain fog**. In the case of **artemin, higher levels are associated with widespread pain, more severe pain and cognitive impairment.**
   >
   > The researchers observed that galectin-9 is shed by stressed neutrophils — the most abundant white blood cells — in long COVID patients. This released **galectin-9 can promote chronic inflammation** by affecting various immune cells, as ++[Elahi’s group reported in a previous study on HIV infection](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34411088/)++.
   >
   > They also found that long COVID **dysregulates the production of red blood cells, which results in an abundance of immature red blood cells** in the blood of these patients. Normally, immature red blood cells are present in the bone marrow but not in the blood of healthy people. It is these immature red blood cells in the blood that suppress the immune system and contribute to the elevation of artemin in the plasma of long COVID patients.

   > In the third study, ++[published last week in *The Lancet Microbe*](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247\\(24\\)00280-5/fulltext)++, Elahi’s team showed there are no signs of systemic SARS-CoV-2 present in the blood of long COVID patients who were examined 12 months after infection — challenging previous assertions that the virus remains present in the blood of long COVID sufferers.
   >
   > So if it’s not the virus itself, what could be causing long COVID? Thanks to the information provided by **galectin-9 and artemin**, Elahi says he has an idea as to what is happening.
   >
   > “I think that **chronic inflammation in long COVID patients results in the elevation of these two proteins**. At the earliest stage of disease, we know that some patients have gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea — but not everybody,” he points out. “I think those individuals who have gastrointestinal involvement are more likely to develop long COVID.”
   >
   > The **gastrointestinal problems result in damage to the intestinal tissues, along with gut leakiness.** It means that if even small traces of microbes from the gut get into the bloodstream, it could result in chronic inflammation in long COVID patients. The team found elevated levels of protein markers associated with gut leakiness in these patients.
   >
   > Elahi says that is actually good news, because these gut problems can be treated. “There are medications available that can be used for gut leakiness. So I think that might be a solution for long COVID patients.”
   >
   > Elahi adds that in a previous study, his team discovered that some long COVID patients had a deficiency in two amino acids, sarcosine and serine, that have anti-inflammatory functions and neuroprotective effects. **Both are available as food supplements that can be purchased at health-food stores or online.** 
   >
   > “Some patients who have taken them have claimed signs of improvement.”

### Summary

#### Measurable markers

- higher levels of immune cells called neutrophils and monocytes 

- fewer protective lymphocytes

- worn-out or exhausted killer T cells

- higher levels of … galectin-9 and artemin

- **abundance of immature red blood cells (reticulocyte)**

- deficiency in two amino acids, sarcosine and serine

#### How to mitigate

sarcosine and serine …  **are available as food supplements that can be purchased**

### Potential Blood Tests

#### CBC

- neutrophils (look for higher levels)

- monocytes (look for higher levels)

- lymphocytes (look for fewer)

#### [T-cell exhaustion](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2842494/)

- appears to require some assay, not available normally)

[Galectin-9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7998537/) and [Artemin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/artemin)

- look for higher levels

- Cant find a normal test for these, but it can be done

#### Immature red blood cells

- “Reticulocyte count” test, [Blood Health](https://healthmatters.io/biomarker-category/blood-health)

- look for higher levels

[Sarcosine](https://healthmatters.io/understand-blood-test-results/sarcosine-plasma) and [Serine](https://healthmatters.io/understand-blood-test-results/serine-14)

- Look for deficiency
