# 💡Bottom-Up Processing in Neurodivergent Brains and Rule Following

## I. Introduction to Bottom-Up Processing in Neurodivergent Brains

Bottom-up processing refers to how sensory information is processed from the environment up to higher-level cognitive functions. In neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), this process can differ from neurotypical individuals.

### Impacts:

1. Sensory sensitivity

2. Difficulty with filtering information

3. Detailed-focused processing

4. Challenges with integration

### Potential causes:

1. Atypical neural connectivity

2. Differences in sensory gating mechanisms

3. Imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters

4. Genetic factors influencing brain development

## II. Key Research Studies

1. Pellicano & Burr (2012): Proposes a Bayesian framework explaining perception in autism, suggesting reduced prior knowledge leads to more "accurate" but potentially overwhelming perception.

2. Robertson & Baron-Cohen (2017): Examines sensory perception in autism across multiple modalities, discussing evidence for both hyper- and hypo-sensitivity.

3. Schulz & Stevenson (2020): Investigates the relationship between sensory hypersensitivity and repetitive behaviors in autistic and typically-developing children.

4. Grzadzinski et al. (2020): Examines sensory reactivity, empathizing, and systemizing in autism spectrum conditions (ASC) and sensory processing disorder (SPD).

5. Marco et al. (2011): Focuses on neurophysiological findings related to sensory processing in autism, discussing evidence for atypical auditory, tactile, and visual processing.

## III. Synthesized High-Level Explanation

Bottom-up processing in neurodivergent brains is characterized by atypical sensory perception and integration. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including altered neural connectivity and imbalances in neurotransmitters. Research suggests that individuals with autism may have a reduced influence of prior expectations on sensory input, leading to a more detail-oriented but potentially overwhelming perception of the world.

These sensory processing differences are observed in various neurodevelopmental conditions and appear to be related to core symptoms such as repetitive behaviors. Neurophysiological studies have provided evidence for these sensory processing differences, showing atypical patterns of neural activity in response to sensory stimuli.

## IV. Bottom-Up Processing and Rule Following

### 1\. Enhanced Detail Processing and Rule Adherence

- Strict interpretation of rules without considering context

- Difficulty in understanding implicit or unwritten rules

- Strong preference for clearly defined, explicit rules

### 2\. Sensory Overload and Rule Following

- Rules may provide a structured framework to navigate overwhelming sensory environments

- Difficulty in following rules in sensory-rich environments due to overload

- Potential for increased anxiety in situations where rules are unclear or conflicting

### 3\. Cognitive Flexibility and Rule Adaptation

- Difficulty in generalizing rules to new situations

- Challenges in understanding exceptions to rules

- Potential rigidity in rule application

### 4\. Executive Functioning and Rule Management

- Difficulty in prioritizing which rules to follow when faced with conflicting guidelines

- Challenges in remembering and applying multiple rules simultaneously

- Potential struggles with initiating rule-following behaviors or stopping rule-breaking ones

### 5\. Social Context and Rule Understanding

- Challenges in picking up on social cues that might indicate when rules can be bent or broken

- Difficulty understanding the intent behind rules, focusing instead on literal interpretation

- Potential for misunderstanding social rules that are often implicit rather than explicit

### 6\. Repetitive Behaviors and Rule Following

- Repetitive adherence to rules as a form of self-regulation or comfort

- Potential distress when rules are changed or broken by others

- Use of rule following as a repetitive behavior to manage sensory overload

## V. Conclusion

The atypical bottom-up processing observed in neurodivergent brains, particularly in ASC, has significant implications for rule following. While this can lead to challenges in social situations and adapting to change, it may also result in strengths such as attention to detail and consistency in rule application. Understanding these connections can inform better support strategies and interventions for neurodivergent individuals in various contexts.

This synthesis provides a framework for understanding how atypical bottom-up processing could influence rule following behaviors in neurodivergent individuals, while acknowledging that individual experiences may vary significantly.
