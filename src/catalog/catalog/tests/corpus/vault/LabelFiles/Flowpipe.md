Readers may also enjoy Flowpipe \[1\], a cloud scripting engine to build workflow pipelines using HCL (like Terraform). It's as-code, self-hosted and open source. Our design choices were a bit different - focus on DevSecOps, composable OSS mods \[2\], first-class support for retries etc \[3\], and the flexibility to run function code or containers when required \[4\].
