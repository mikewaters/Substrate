# Complexity Management

Make difficult things less difficult. 

I suffer from distraction issues, and so complexity efficiency can be gained by reducing distractions.

I have too much shit going on, and so complexity efficiency gan be gained by permitting me to focus only on whats important, and safely push away things that will (or may) only be impotant later or even someday.
