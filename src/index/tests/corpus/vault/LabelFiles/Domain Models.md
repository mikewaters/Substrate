# Domain Models

I might be tempted to use the term Taxonomy instead, but the model IMO is more complex than parent/child (i.e. I’ve made it more complex because I’ve designed domain models before)

There are a number of domains that are modeled:

- System³ domain model

- Work model

- Information model

- Brain² model

It is OK for these to share - or more accurately - reference, each other’s models.
