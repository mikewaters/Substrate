# Compressing the Onerous Information Space

I can simplify all of this by replacing “collecting” with hints for a future Me. An article about kinda-future-project P is useful, but could possibly be replaced with tips on how to find that article again - deferring effort to the future. These hints may even be superior to the article, if they return even more useful results.

It might be smart to also defer highlighting; just making a note that there are potential highlights would be enough.

Imagine clearing YouTube playlists?? Closing 359 tabs?
