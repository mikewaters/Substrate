# Overlord

In order to do this, an Overlord system must know what information is stored where, and have enough contextual understanding to correlate information between systems. With this in place, a “table of contents” can be generated to support different specific user stories, like “Where are all the materials for this project, what is its status, and when is its deadline”, “Where have I written about this topic, I want to consolidate”, and “Show my recent journal entries, topics I’ve been thinking about, learning tracks I am working, interleaved with where I was for each entry and the quality of sleep I had the night before”.
