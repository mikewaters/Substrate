What if I told you that you're not actually lazy but your resistance and unwillingness to do something stems from an emotional resistance when there's something that you want to do whether that be learning a new skill or doing something fun like drawing or creating art you may experience that you just really don't want to do it when you sit down to actually do those things now when we experience the feeling of not wanting to do that we call ourselves lazy instead of understanding why we don't want to do that thing and at the same time we don't allow ourselves to feel the feeling of not wanting to do that thing we just don't do it at all in order to not feel the feeling of wanting to do that thing so really this is resistance toward the feeling of not wanting to do something the feeling of not wanting to do something is a layer of resistance and protection against a deeper in our wound it's easy to gloss over it and see that you are being lazy it's a lot more difficult to sit with that discomfort that comes with the feeling of not wanting to do something and understand what kind of core pain is underneath and there can be different negative leaves and core wounds that are underneath this feeling it can be the belief that you are not good enough you are not smart enough that you are dumb that you are only lovable and acceptable when you're doing things well at the core of this negative belief is an experience that you had that left you with an emotional trauma of only receiving love when you were performing well and if you didn't you were abandoned criticized neglected and ignored so it's not that you were lazy but there is a part of you that is trying to protect you from this pain so really laziness is just rooted and not fully understanding why you react this way to things that you want to do or you don't want to do the automatic resistance that you have towards these emotions and negative beliefs how you can dissolve each layer of resistance to arrive at the core wound is by meeting each layer with acknowledgment allowance and acceptance instead of criticizing yourself as lazy try to understand why you feel this way what emotion do you want to avoid what do you think you will feel as a result of doing this thing and ultimately how can you show yourself love and compassion each step of the way and when you arrive at the core wound where you were neglected or ignored because you weren't performing well enough can you be with this part of yourself that is hurting from this pain you show love and forgiveness to this part of yourself can you embrace and integrate this rejected part of yourself back to union within yourself overcoming laziness isn't done with more robotic discipline or whipping yourself even more but rather it lies and giving yourself a safe space to experience these emotions fully and remembering that you have the strength and courage within to feel these emotions as they come up
