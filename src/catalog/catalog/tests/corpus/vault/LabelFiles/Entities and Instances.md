# Entities and Instances

Rules:

1. Entities are singular tense (“Project”, “Outcome”, “Entity”)

2. Instances are pluralized entities (“Projects”, “Outcomes”, “Entities”) unless referring to a singular instance, in which case the singular tense is prefixed by an indefinite Article (‘an’, ‘a’) unless of course the definite article is called for - but in this case it would be referred to by its name and hyperlink.

This sounds so stupid, but if I don’t document it I will forget it and choose to do something else thereby fucking myself.
