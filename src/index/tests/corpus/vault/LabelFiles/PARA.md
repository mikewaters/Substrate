# My PARA usage

### Basic PARA

- **P**rojects

   - This should not contain child folders that are subcategories (health, finance etc)’ instead, the folders should be *more granular* as well as descriptive

- **R**esources

   - this *should* contain subfolders

- **A**rchives

### System³

- Inspiration/

- Vision Boards/

- Goals/

- Big Ideas/

- Things/

### Quick Access

Documentation for things I use a lot, sorta “books on my desk”

- Reference/

   - Roam Research/

Docs for systems I use a lot; if Raindrop could hyperlink within itself, this would be a link to *Resources*/

- Programming/

   - Browser Automation/
