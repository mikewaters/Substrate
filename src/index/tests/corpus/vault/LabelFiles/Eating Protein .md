# Eating Protein 

Biological

<https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-protein-can-help-you-lose-weight>

**Protein changes the levels of several weight-regulating hormones**

Your weight is actively [regulated byTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK555906/) your brain, particularly by an area called the hypothalamus.

To determine when and how much you should eat, your brain processes multiple types of information.

Some of the most important signals to your brain come from hormones that change in response to feeding.

A higher protein intake actually [increases your levelsTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7539343/) of the satiety (appetite-reducing) hormones GLP-1, peptide YY, and cholecystokinin while reducing your levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin.

Protein reduces your levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin while boosting the appetite-reducing hormones GLP-1, peptide YY, and cholecystokinin. By reducing hunger and increasing satiety, eating more protein may help you naturally consume fewer calories overall, thus supporting weight loss.

An estimated 20 to 30% of the calories from protein are burned while your body is digesting and metabolizing the protein.

Due to the high thermic effect and a positive effect on resting energy expenditure and maintaining lean muscle, a high protein intake [tends toTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6087750/) boost metabolism.

It makes you burn more calories around the clock, including during [sleep](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-reasons-why-good-sleep-is-important).

High protein diets are highly satiating, so they lead to reduced hunger and appetite compared with lower protein diets. This makes it much easier to restrict calories on a high protein diet.

Losing muscle is a side effect of weight loss that most people don’t want.

Another side effect of losing weight is that your metabolic rate [tends to decreaseTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572145/).

In other words, you end up burning fewer calories than you did before you lost the weight.

This is often referred to as metabolic compensation, and it can [amount toTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/28481261/) several hundred fewer calories burned each day.

Eating plenty of protein [can reduceTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6566799/) muscle loss, which should help keep your metabolic rate higher as you lose body fat.

Strength training is another major factor that [can reduceTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9657634/) muscle loss and metabolic slowdown when losing weight.

For this reason, a high protein intake and heavy strength training are two incredibly important components of an effective fat loss plan.

The DRI (Dietary Reference Intake) for protein is only [46 grams (g)Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t4/) and 56 g for the average woman and man, respectively.

This amount may be enough to prevent deficiency, but it’s far from optimal if you’re trying to lose weight (or gain muscle).

can also aim for a certain number based on your weight. For example, aiming for [0\.7 to 1 gTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7353221/) of protein per pound of lean mass (1.5 to 2.2 grams per kilogram) is a common recommendation.

determine your daily protein intake for weight loss, aim for 30% of your total calorie intake or 0.7 to 1 g of protein per pound of body weight.
