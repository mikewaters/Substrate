# Heptabase Architecture

Heptabase uses an accessible SQLite database and supports an import function that supports various flavors of markdown. 

Local storage in Heptabase is accomplished using a local SQLite3 file. From a read of the code, the original datastore was (is/) Firebase.

DB location: `/Users/mike/Library/Application Support/project-meta/hepta.db`
