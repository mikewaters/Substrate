# Harmful Avoidance Tactics

These tactics can:

- make the future worse in some way

- cause me to disengage from activities that I like or love

Examples:

1. I do not want to look at emails (texts, calls, PKM, task list, desk), and so I:

   1. miss something important

   2. continue to accumulate cruft from un-triaged items, making the future worse

   3. dread opening my computer, meaning I’ll miss out on cool things

   4. crawl into a TikTok haze, and waste hours and hours of productive stuff

   5. not move my life forward
