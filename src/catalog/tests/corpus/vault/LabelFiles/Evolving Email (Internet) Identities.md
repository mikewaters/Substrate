# Evolving Email (Internet) Identities

Is a:: State

I primarily use Google as an IDP, or delegate to Apple IDP using that Google address.

   - current Main identity Provider

- mike@mikewaters.net

## Target State

Decoupled from Google and Apple ID federation, decoupled from google completely for mail storage.

## Getting There
