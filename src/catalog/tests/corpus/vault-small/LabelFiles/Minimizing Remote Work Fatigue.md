# Minimizing Remote Work Fatigue

[The science of “Zoom fatigue”](https://bigthink.com/business/not-remotely-cool-the-science-of-zoom-fatigue/) discussion: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41870914>

Tips:

- **Hide Self-View**: Turn off your self-view to avoid the stress of constantly seeing yourself on screen, which can lead to self-consciousness and fatigue

- **Reduce Screen Stimuli**: Use speaker view to minimize distractions and close other programs to focus solely on the meeting

- **Use Captions**

- **Hear your own voice**

## Vocal Feedback

By providing feedback, sidetone mimics natural conversation settings, reducing the tendency to speak loudly due to lack of auditory feedback

- Consider using devices with built-in sidetone features or external audio interfaces that offer low-latency monitoring for clearer sound

> I optimized for this style setup about a year into the pandemic, but using a Beyerdynamic MX300 wired gaming headset. The headset is closed-back, so to get voice feedback ("sidetone") I use an inexpensive Behringer XENYX USB302 mixer. It allows for adjusting the mic/audio mix going to my headphones, and also is a USB audio interface.
>
> This setup is as minimal as I was able to get it: no big booms on my desk to move around, microphones blocking my video, etc. Yeah, I look like a pilot on calls, but the audio quality is amazing. Also, the mic being close to me blocks background noise, and isolates it from my desk. Sometimes my colleagues with podcaster-style mics have issues with mechanical transmission from their desk setups, while I have none.
>
> People often comment — even to this day — about my audio quality. I talk to people all day, being in sales, and it makes a huge difference in my presence and professionalism. Absolutely worth every penny I spent.

> Unfortunately since it’s an active feature it requires power, meaning any wired headset will require a battery or other power source.
>
> A wired headset plus my mixer gives me an opportunity to tinker and upgrade my setup as I wish, and is all USB powered to boot.

# **Quick Guide: Sidetone/Voice Monitoring for your (Gaming) Headset and Mic**

After buying Beyer MMX300 close back headphones I really wanted a sidetone feature for my mic, so after doing hours of reasearch and testing out different stuff, here are your options!



**Software (Voicemeter/Windows Settings), free:**

- Delay no matter how you tweak it! You'll probably feel drunk trying to form a whole sentence, but worth a try

- *Go into Sounds (type in "Change System Sounds" or right click taskbar volume symbol) -> Recording -> Right click your Mics Name -> Listen-> Listen to this device -OR- download Voicemeter*

**Cheap USB mini Dacs, $10-30:**

- Not worth the hassle, likely quiet sidetone or backround noise, only try with free shipping/return

- *Go into Sounds (type in "Change System Sounds" or right click taskbar volume symbol) -> Playback -> Your Headphones/Adapter Name -> Levels -> Microphone Slider -OR- use their software*

**Apple/Google 3.5 to USB-C Dongle DAC, $10:**

- Googles Sidetone much too quiet for loud ingame volume but good enough for casual Browsing/Discord or playing at a low volume, Apples Dongle is even worses

- *Go into Sounds (type in "Change System Sounds" or right click taskbar volume symbol) -> Playback -> Your Headphones/Adapter Name-> Levels -> Microphone (Slider)*

My Winner: Behringer Xenyx 302, 70$

- Super easy to set up, adjustable Sidetone, no backround noise

- *Connect Mic and Headphone 3.5 with top right Jacks below "Headset"; Connect USB with PC; "Phones" to lowest level possible and "LINE/USB" to your prefered sound volume; "MIC" to max and "Gain" to adjust sidetone volume; Press red button "LINE IN USB PLAY"*



I hope this saves you from hours of reseach and wasted time! If all this is too complicated, just get open back headphones like the Sennheiser PC 37X OR closed backs with build in sidetone. On a sidenote: Im no audio geek, and this thread is not for you if you are.
