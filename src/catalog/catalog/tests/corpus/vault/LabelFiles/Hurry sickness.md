# Hurry sickness

Hurry sickness (also known as time urgency) is a behavior pattern characterized by a constant sense of urgency and a chronic feeling of being rushed—even when there’s no real need to hurry. It’s not a formal medical diagnosis, but it’s widely recognized in psychology and stress research.



Signs of Hurry Sickness:

• Always multitasking, even during leisure

• Irritation when delays happen (e.g., traffic, slow walkers)

• Feeling guilty when resting or not being productive

• Over-scheduling and underestimating how long things take

• Racing against the clock, even in low-stakes situations



Causes:

• Cultural pressure to be productive all the time

• Work environments that reward speed and hustle

• Personal perfectionism or fear of missing out (FOMO)



Consequences:

• Chronic stress and burnout

• Decreased focus and quality of work

• Strained relationships due to impatience

• Health issues like high blood pressure



Coping Strategies:

• Practice mindfulness or meditation

• Set realistic schedules and prioritize

• Embrace single-tasking

• Build in buffer time between activities

• Redefine success beyond productivity
