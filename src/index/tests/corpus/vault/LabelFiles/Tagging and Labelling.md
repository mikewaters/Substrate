# Tagging and Labelling

 ## Agents

> <https://github.com/HumanSignal/Adala>

> Adala offers a robust framework for implementing agents specialized in data processing, with an emphasis on diverse data labeling tasks. These agents are autonomous, meaning they can independently acquire one or more skills through iterative learning. This learning process is influenced by their operating environment, observations, and reflections. Users define the environment by providing a ground truth dataset. Every agent learns and applies its skills in what we refer to as a "runtime", synonymous with LLM.
