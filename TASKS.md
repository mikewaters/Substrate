## Task management
- This project uses `bd` commands instead of markdown TODOs or other methods of task tracking.
- Only use `bd` when breaking down coding tasks (always use `bd` for coding tasks!), **not** for general reasoning.
- Always create task descriptions in beads, even if they are short.
- When creating tasks using `bd`, always identify any tasks that are parallelizeable using subagents. If two tasks will not touch the same code files, they can probablybe parallelized.
- Always follow the beads SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL , found in `bd prime` agent instructions.
