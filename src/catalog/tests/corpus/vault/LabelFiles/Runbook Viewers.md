### Runme

Open source

> [Runme](https://runme.dev/) is a tool that makes runbooks actually runnable, making it easier to follow step-by-step instructions. Shell/bash, Python, Ruby, Javascript/Typescript, Lua, PHP, Perl, and many other runtimes are supported via Runme's shebang feature

> Runme achieves this by literally running markdown. More specifically, Runme runs your commands (shell, bash, zsh) or code inside your fenced code blocks.

> Runme persists your runbooks in markdown, which your docs are likely already using.
