# The Zeigarnik Effect

> The Zeigarnik Effect is the power of unfinished business or interrupted or uncompleted activity to hold a privileged place in [memory](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/memory "Psychology Today looks at memory"). Unfinished tasks create a cognitive burden, weigh more heavily on the mind, and are more easily recalled than completed tasks.

+ The Zeigarnik Effect is a psychological phenomenon that describes the tendency to remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. This effect was first observed by the Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik in the 1920s when she noticed that waiters seemed to remember orders only as long as the order was in the process of being served. Once the order was completed, the waiters seemed to forget the details of it.

+ Zeigarnik theorized that people remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better because they cause a kind of mental tension that improves cognitive retention. This tension is relieved once the task is completed, reducing the need to remember it. As a result, uncompleted tasks are more likely to stay on our minds until we finish them, often intruding into our thoughts.

+ The Zeigarnik Effect has implications for productivity and learning:

   - **Productivity:** It suggests that if someone starts a task, they are more compelled to finish it. This can be used to manage procrastination by encouraging the initiation of tasks.

   - **Learning and Education:** Breaking down information into segments and leaving some questions unanswered during teaching sessions may help students retain information, as they may feel the need to resolve their incomplete understanding.

+ However, the strength and universality of the Zeigarnik Effect have been debated, with some studies supporting it and others finding little evidence for it, suggesting it may depend on individual differences and specific circumstances.
